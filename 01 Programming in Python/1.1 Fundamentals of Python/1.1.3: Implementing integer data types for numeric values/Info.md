# LO-3: Implement Integer Data Types

## Learning Objective
Students will understand and work with integer (int) data types in Python.

## Duration
10-15 minutes

## Key Concepts
1. **Integers**: Whole numbers (positive, negative, zero)
2. **Integer Operations**: Arithmetic with whole numbers
3. **Integer Division**: `//` vs `/`
4. **Use Cases**: Counting, indexing, whole quantities

## Learning Outcomes
- [ ] Create integer variables
- [ ] Perform integer arithmetic
- [ ] Understand integer vs float division
- [ ] Know when to use integers

## Real-World Applications
- **Counting**: Number of students, items in stock
- **Ages**: Person's age in years
- **Years**: Calendar years, durations
- **IDs**: User IDs, product codes

## Common Misconceptions
1. Division always returns integer → No, `/` returns float
2. Integers have size limits → Not in Python 3!
3. Can't mix int and float → You can, result is float

## Success Criteria
- Create and manipulate integer variables
- Choose appropriate operations
- Explain difference between `/` and `//`

## Next Steps
**LO-4**: Implement Float Data Types
