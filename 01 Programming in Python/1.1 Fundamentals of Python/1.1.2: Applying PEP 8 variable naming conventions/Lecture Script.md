## Duration: 10-15 minutes

## [0:00-0:02] Hook
**Say**: "You can name variables almost anything... but should you? Let's learn the rules and best practices!"

**Show**: 
```python
x = 10      # Valid but unclear
age = 10    # Valid and clear!
```

## [0:02-0:07] Naming Rules (5 min)

**Demonstrate each rule with live coding:**

1. Start with letter/underscore
2. Only letters/numbers/underscores
3. Case sensitive
4. No reserved keywords

**Live Code Examples** of errors, explain each

## [0:07-0:12] Conventions (5 min)

**Teach snake_case**:
```python
student_name = "Alice"  # Pythonic!
```

**Show bad examples** and improve them together

## [0:12-0:15] Practice & Wrap-up (3 min)

**Exercise**: Fix these names:
- `2name` → `name` or `name_2`
