# LO-2.6: Building Lists Efficiently with Comprehensions

## Learning Objective
Students will be able to write list comprehensions to create, transform, and filter lists concisely and efficiently in Python.

## Duration
25-30 minutes

## Key Concepts Covered
1. List comprehension syntax and structure
2. Basic comprehensions for transformation
3. Filtering with conditions
4. Conditional expressions (if-else)
5. Nested list comprehensions
6. Comparison with traditional loops
7. When to use comprehensions vs loops

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of lists (LO-2.1)
- Knowledge of list iteration (LO-2.5)
- Familiarity with conditionals
- Understanding of for loops

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Write basic list comprehensions to transform data
- Apply filtering conditions within comprehensions
- Use conditional expressions for branching logic
- Convert traditional loops to list comprehensions
- Recognize when comprehensions improve code readability
- Identify situations where loops are preferable
- Create nested comprehensions for 2D data
- Write Pythonic, efficient list creation code

## Real-World Applications
- Data transformation and cleaning
- Filtering datasets based on criteria
- Mathematical operations on number sequences
- String manipulation and text processing
- Creating formatted output lists
- Parsing and extracting data from files
- Building configuration or lookup lists
- Performance-critical list operations
