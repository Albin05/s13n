# **2. Short Answer**

### **Q4.** Explain Generative AI in your own words.

### **Q5.** List two differences between classical ML and Generative AI.

### **Q6.** Give two real-world applications where Generative AI is better suited than classical ML.

### **Q7.** Why do generative models produce different outputs even with the same prompt?

---

# **3. Long Answer**

### **Q8.** Compare classical ML and generative AI on these three dimensions:

* Input requirements
* Output type
* Flexibility

### **Q9.** A business wants to automate customer support with conversational responses. Analyze whether classical ML or Generative AI is more suitable and justify with two reasons.

### **Q10.** Evaluate whether generative AI can replace classical ML for analytical tasks like fraud detection. Provide arguments for and against.

# **4. Implementation Questions**

### **Q11.** Load any small pre-trained generative model (e.g., GPT-2 / Gemma-2-2B) and generate 3 different outputs for the same prompt.

* Compare the variation in outputs
* Explain why this behavior occurs

### **Q12.** Train a simple classical ML model (e.g., logistic regression) on a small text dataset for sentiment classification.

Then:

* Use a generative model to create 5 synthetic sentences
* Classify them using your classical ML model
* Analyze differences in how both models “use” data

### **Q13.** Build a mini workflow that combines:

* Classical ML → classify the topic of a sentence
* Generative AI → expand the sentence into a paragraph
  Explain your architecture and why both types of models serve different purposes.
