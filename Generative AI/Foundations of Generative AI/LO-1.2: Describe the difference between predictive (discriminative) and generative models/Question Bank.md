# **Question Bank for LO-1.2: Predictive (Discriminative) vs Generative Models**

---

# **1. MCQs (Bloom: Remember / Understand)**

### **Q1.** Predictive (discriminative) models primarily learn:

a) P(X) only
b) P(Y | X) — the boundary between classes
c) P(X, Y) — the full data distribution
d) How to generate new samples
**Answer: b**

---

### **Q2.** Which model type can generate new samples that resemble the training data?

a) Discriminative models
b) Regression models
c) Generative models
d) Linear models
**Answer: c**

---

### **Q3.** Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest belong to which category?

a) Generative
b) Predictive / Discriminative
c) Hybrid generative
d) None of the above
**Answer: b**

---

# **2. Short Answer Questions (Bloom: Understand / Apply)**

### **Q4.** Define a discriminative model in your own words.

### **Q5.** Give one example of a generative model and one example of a discriminative model.

### **Q6.** Explain why generative models need to learn the full data distribution.

### **Q7.** Describe a scenario where a generative model would be more useful than a predictive model.

---

# **3. Long Answer Questions (Bloom: Analyze / Evaluate)**

### **Q8.** Compare predictive vs generative models based on these aspects:

* What they learn
* What they output
* Their typical use cases

---

### **Q9.** A company wants to build a fraud detection system.

Should they use a discriminative or generative model?
Analyze both options and justify your recommendation.

---

### **Q10.** “Generative models are more powerful because they learn more than discriminative models.”

Evaluate this statement with arguments for and against.

---

# **4. Implementation Questions (Bloom: Apply / Analyze / Create)**

### **Q11.** Train a small discriminative model (e.g., logistic regression) on the Iris or MNIST dataset.

Then answer:

* What exactly is the model learning?
* How does the decision boundary behave?
* Why can’t it generate a new sample?

---

### **Q12.** Use a small generative model (e.g., a Variational Autoencoder or a simple LLM).

Perform the following:

* Generate 5 synthetic samples
* Compare these with real samples
* Explain how this demonstrates learning P(X)

---

### **Q13.** Build a simple experiment demonstrating the difference:

1. Use a discriminative model to classify digits (0–9)
2. Use a generative model to create new digits
3. Compare the goals, outputs, and training behavior

Discuss what each model “understands” about the data.
