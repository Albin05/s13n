# **4. Implementation Questions**

### **Q11.** Case Study: Marketing Campaign.
*   Scenario: You are launching a new sneaker brand.
*   Task: Describe a workflow using GenAI tools to create:
    1.  A slogan (Text)
    2.  Product images (Image)
    3.  A promotional video script (Text)
    *   Identify which type of model (LLM, Diffusion, etc.) you would use for each step.

### **Q12.** Code Translation (Conceptual).
*   Scenario: You have a Python function that calculates compound interest.
*   Task: Use an LLM (like ChatGPT) to translate this function into JavaScript.
*   Compare the two snippets. Did the logic change? Did the syntax change correctly?

### **Q13.** Synthetic Data Generation.
*   Scenario: You need to train a model to detect credit card fraud, but you cannot use real customer data due to privacy laws.
*   Task: Explain how you would use a Generative Model to create a "Synthetic Dataset" that mimics the statistical properties of real fraud data without exposing anyone's identity.
