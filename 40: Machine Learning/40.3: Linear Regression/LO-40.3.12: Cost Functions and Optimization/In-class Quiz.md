# In-Class Quiz

## Question 1
Why is the Cost Function for Linear Regression (MSE) considered "easy" to optimize?
A. Because it is always 0.
B. Because it is a Convex function (bowl-shaped), ensuring a single Global Minimum.
C. Because it has many Local Minima to choose from.
D. Because it does not require calculus.

## Question 2
If you change your Cost Function from **MSE (L2)** to **MAE (L1)**, how does the model's behavior change regarding outliers?
A. The model tries harder to fit the outliers.
B. The model cares less about outliers compared to MSE.
C. The model ignores all data except outliers.
D. The model becomes unstable and crashes.

## Question 3
In the context of optimization, what is a "Global Minimum"?
A. The lowest point in the entire Cost Function landscape.
B. The point where the gradient is maximum.
C. A point where the cost is low, but there might be a lower point nearby.
D. The starting point of Gradient Descent.
