# Introduction to Regression Problems

## Concept
In Machine Learning, **Regression** is a type of Supervised Learning where the goal is to predict a **continuous numerical value**.
* "Continuous" means the value can be any number within a range (e.g., 3.14, 100, -50.2).
* This is distinct from **Classification**, where the goal is to predict a specific category or label (e.g., "Cat", "Dog", "Spam").

## The Core Question
Regression answers questions like **"How much?"** or **"How many?"**
* How much will this house sell for?
* How many units will we sell next month?
* What will the temperature be tomorrow?

## Real-World Analogy
Imagine predicting a student's performance.
* **Regression:** Predicting the exact score (e.g., 87.5%).
* **Classification:** Predicting the grade letter (e.g., A, B, C) or Pass/Fail.
