# Question Bank: Slope and Intercept

## Q1 (MCQ)
**Problem:** Which parameter would you adjust to move a line **upwards** without changing its steepness?
A. Decrease the Slope $\theta_1$.
B. Increase the Slope $\theta_1$.
C. Decrease the Intercept $\theta_0$.
D. Increase the Intercept $\theta_0$.

## Q2 (Coding)
**Problem:** Write a function `get_line_params(p1, p2)` that takes two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` and returns the Slope $m$ and Intercept $c$.
*Formulas:* $m = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)$, $c = y1 - m*x1$.
**Input:** `(0, 0)`, `(2, 4)`
**Output:** `m=2.0, c=0.0`

## Q3 (NAT)
**Problem:** A line passes through the points $(2, 5)$ and $(4, 11)$. What is the value of the **Slope**?

## Q4 (MSQ)
**Problem:** Select all equations that represent a line passing through the origin $(0,0)$.
A. $y = 5x$
B. $y = 2x + 1$
C. $y = -3x + 0$
D. $y = 0.5x - 5$

## Q5 (Coding)
**Problem:** Generate a dataset.
1. Create an X array from 0 to 10.
2. Create Y using $y = 2.5x + 10$.
3. Return the Y array.
**Input:** None.
**Output:** Array of Y values.

## Q6 (Subjective)
**Problem:** In a model predicting house prices, explain a scenario where a **Negative Slope** would make sense, and a scenario where a **Negative Intercept** would make sense (or why it might be problematic).
