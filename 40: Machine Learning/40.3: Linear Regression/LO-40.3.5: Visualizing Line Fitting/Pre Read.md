# Visualizing Line Fitting

## Concept
In Linear Regression, our goal is to find the "Best Fit Line." But what does "Best Fit" actually look like?

When we plot data points on a scatter plot, they are rarely perfectly aligned. Any line we draw will miss some (or most) of the points.
* **The Residual:** The vertical distance between a real data point ($y$) and the point on the line directly below or above it ($\hat{y}$).
* **Fitting:** The process of wiggling the line (changing slope and intercept) until these vertical distances are as small as possible on average.

## Real-World Analogy: The Rubber Band
Imagine the data points are nails hammered into a board. You stretch a rubber band (the line) across the board. You connect each nail to the rubber band with a vertical spring.
* If the line is far from the nails, the springs are stretched tight (High Energy/Error).
* The "Best Fit Line" is the position where the rubber band settles to minimize the tension in all springs combined.
