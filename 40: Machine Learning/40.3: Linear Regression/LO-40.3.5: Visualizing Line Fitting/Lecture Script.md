### Hook (3 min)
Show scattered points on board
Ask: "Draw a line through these"
Multiple students draw different lines
Say: "Which is best? Today we learn how to decide!"

### Main Content (18 min)
**What is Line Fitting (5 min)**
- Goal: line close to all points
- House price example
- Plot points → draw line
- Visual representation

**Good vs Poor Fit (6 min)**
- Good fit: points cluster
- Poor fit: points scattered
- Residuals explained
- Calculate example residual
- Visual comparison

**The Fitting Process (7 min)**
- Start with random line
- Calculate errors
- Adjust line
- Iterate until best
- Show progression visually
- Student scores example

### Exercise (2 min)
"Given points: (1,3), (2,5), (3,7)
Which line fits better?
A: y = 2x + 1
B: y = 3x"

### Wrap-up (2 min)
- Fitting = minimizing residuals
- Visual check for quality
- Iterative process
- Next: How to adjust mathematically!
