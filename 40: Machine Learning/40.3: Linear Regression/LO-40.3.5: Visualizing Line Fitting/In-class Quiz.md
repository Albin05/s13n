## Question 1
In a standard Linear Regression plot, the "Error" or "Residual" is measured as:

B. The vertical distance from the point to the line.
C. The perpendicular (shortest) distance from the point to the line.
D. The distance from the point to the origin.

## Question 2
If a data point lies exactly **on** the regression line, what is its residual?
A. 1
B. Infinity
C. 0
D. Undefined

## Question 3
Visually, if you see that your regression line consistently stays **below** the data points for high values of $x$ and **above** the data points for low values of $x$, this indicates:
A. A perfect fit.
B. The line has the wrong slope (it is tilted incorrectly).
C. The line has the wrong intercept (it is shifted too low).
D. The data is perfectly linear.
