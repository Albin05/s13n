# Regression vs Classification

## Concept
Supervised Machine Learning problems are broadly divided into two categories based on the **type of output** they predict.

1.  **Regression:** The task of predicting a **Continuous Quantity**.
    * *Question:* "How much?" or "How many?"
    * *Examples:* Predicting house prices, temperature, stock values, or a person's height.
    * *Output:* A number (e.g., $45,000, 23.5°C).

2.  **Classification:** The task of predicting a **Discrete Class Label**.
    * *Question:* "Which one?" or "Yes/No?"
    * *Examples:* Is this email Spam? Is this tumor benign? Is this image a Cat or a Dog?
    * *Output:* A category (e.g., 0 or 1, "Red" or "Blue").

## Real-World Analogy: The Weather Forecast
* **Regression Model:** Predicts the *exact amount* of rainfall in millimeters (e.g., 12.5mm).
* **Classification Model:** Predicts *whether* it will rain (e.g., "Yes" or "No").
