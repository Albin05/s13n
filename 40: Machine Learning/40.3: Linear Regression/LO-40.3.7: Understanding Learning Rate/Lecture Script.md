### Hook (3 min)
Ask: "Walk to the door with eyes closed"
Student takes tiny steps → "Too slow!"
Student takes huge steps → "You'll crash!"
Say: "Learning rate is finding the right step size!"

### Main Content (18 min)
**What is Learning Rate (5 min)**
- Definition: step size
- Formula: new = old + η × error
- Typical values
- Why we need it

**Visual Understanding (8 min)**
- Hill descent analogy
- Too large: overshoot
- Too small: slow
- Just right: efficient
- Show error curves for each

**Practical Guidelines (5 min)**
- How to choose
- Start with 0.01
- Symptoms of wrong η
- House price example
- Iterations shown

### Exercise (2 min)
"Error is oscillating wildly. Learning rate is 0.5.
What should you do?"

### Wrap-up (2 min)
- η controls step size
- Balance speed and stability
- Start 0.01, adjust as needed
- Next: Complete algorithm!
