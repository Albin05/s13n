# Question Bank: Linear Relationships

## Q1 (MCQ)
**Problem:** Which value represents the "Y-Intercept" in the linear equation $y = 5x - 2$?
A. 5
B. x
C. -2
D. y

## Q2 (Coding)
**Problem:** Write a function `calculate_y(x, m, c)` that returns the value of $y$ given the input $x$, slope $m$, and intercept $c$.
**Input:** `x=4, m=2, c=1`
**Output:** `9`

## Q3 (NAT)
**Problem:** A dataset shows that for every 1 extra hour of training, an athlete runs 2 minutes faster. If they start with a baseline time of 60 minutes (at 0 training hours), what will their time be after 5 hours of training? (Note: "Runs faster" means time *decreases*).

## Q4 (MSQ)
**Problem:** Which of the following relationships are likely **Non-Linear** (Curved)?
A. The area of a square vs. the length of its side ($Area = side^2$).
B. The total cost of apples vs. weight in kg ($Cost = Price \times Weight$).
C. Bacterial growth over time (Doubling every hour).
D. Distance traveled at constant speed vs. Time.

## Q5 (Coding)
**Problem:** You have two arrays `x = [1, 2, 3]` and `y = [2, 4, 6]`. Write a function to check if the relationship is perfectly linear.
*Hint: Check if the slope between consecutive points is constant.*

## Q6 (Subjective)
**Problem:** Explain why it is dangerous to force a Linear Regression model onto data that has a **Curved** (Non-linear) relationship. Give an example where a straight line would result in very poor predictions at the extremes (very low or very high X values).
