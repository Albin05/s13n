# Understanding Linear Relationships

## Concept
A **Linear Relationship** describes a situation where a change in one variable is directly proportional to a change in another variable. If you plot the data points on a graph, they roughly form a **straight line**.

The mathematical formula for a line is:
$$y = mx + c$$
* **$y$**: The variable we want to predict (Dependent Variable).
* **$x$**: The input variable (Independent Variable).
* **$m$**: The **Slope** (How steep the line is). It tells us how much $y$ changes for every 1 unit increase in $x$.
* **$c$**: The **Y-Intercept** (Where the line starts). It is the value of $y$ when $x = 0$.

## Real-World Example: Taxi Fare
Imagine a taxi charges a base fee of \$5 plus \$2 for every kilometer driven.
* **Equation:** $Cost = 2 \times Distance + 5$
* If you drive 0 km, Cost = \$5 (Intercept).
* If you drive 10 km, Cost = $2(10) + 5 = \$25$.
* This is a perfect linear relationship.
