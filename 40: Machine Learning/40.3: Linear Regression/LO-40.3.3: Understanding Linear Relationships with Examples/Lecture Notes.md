# Understanding Linear Relationships

## The Anatomy of a Line
$$y = mx + c$$
or in ML notation:
$$h_\theta(x) = \theta_1 x + \theta_0$$

### 1. The Slope ($m$ or $\theta_1$)
* Determines the **direction** and **steepness**.
* **Positive Slope ($m > 0$):** As $x$ increases, $y$ increases. (e.g., Ice Cream Sales vs Temperature).
* **Negative Slope ($m < 0$):** As $x$ increases, $y$ decreases. (e.g., Car Value vs Age).
* **Zero Slope ($m = 0$):** $y$ is constant regardless of $x$. No relationship.

### 2. The Intercept ($c$ or $\theta_0$)
* Determines the **offset**.
* The value of $y$ when $x = 0$.
* *Example:* Base salary before commission.

## Correlation
* **Strong Linear Relationship:** Points fall exactly on or very close to the line.
* **Weak Linear Relationship:** Points follow the trend but are scattered widely (High Noise).
* **Non-Linear Relationship:** Points form a curve (e.g., parabola) instead of a line.
