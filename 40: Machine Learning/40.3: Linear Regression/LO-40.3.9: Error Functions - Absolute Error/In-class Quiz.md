## Question 1
What is the primary reason we use the **Absolute Value** function $|y - \hat{y}|$ instead of just the simple difference $(y - \hat{y})$ when calculating the total error?
A. To make the numbers smaller.
B. To ensure that positive and negative errors don't cancel each other out.
C. To square the result.
D. To convert the result to a percentage.

## Question 2
The **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** has the same unit as:
A. The square of the target variable ($y^2$).
B. The square root of the target variable ($\sqrt{y}$).
C. The target variable ($y$) itself.
D. It has no unit (dimensionless).

## Question 3
Compared to Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is:
A. More sensitive to outliers (punishes them harder).
B. Less sensitive to outliers (punishes them linearly).
C. Always zero.
D. Harder to interpret physically.
