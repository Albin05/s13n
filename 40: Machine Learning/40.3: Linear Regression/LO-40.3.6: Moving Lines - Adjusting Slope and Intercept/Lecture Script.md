### Hook (3 min)
Draw line on board
Move it up → "What changed?" (intercept)
Rotate it → "What changed?" (slope)
Say: "Today we learn to adjust lines mathematically!"

### Main Content (18 min)
**Adjusting Slope (6 min)**
- Increase → rotate counterclockwise
- Decrease → rotate clockwise
- Visual demonstrations
- Example with specific point
- Show effect

**Adjusting Intercept (5 min)**
- Increase → shift up
- Decrease → shift down
- Parallel movement
- Example with specific point
- Show effect

**Complete Adjustment (7 min)**
- Four quadrants rule
- When to adjust what
- Step-by-step example
- House prices walkthrough
- Iterations shown

### Exercise (2 min)
"Point (3, 25). Line y = 5x + 5 predicts 20.
Calculate error. Which way to adjust?"

### Wrap-up (2 min)
- Slope → rotation
- Intercept → shift
- Small adjustments better
- Next: Learning rate!
