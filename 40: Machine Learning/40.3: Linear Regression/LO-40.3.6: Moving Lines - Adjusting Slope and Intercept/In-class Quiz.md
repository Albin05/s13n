# In-Class Quiz

## Question 1
If you have a line $y = 2x + 3$ and you change the equation to $y = 2x + 8$, how does the geometric position of the line change?
A. It rotates clockwise.
B. It rotates counter-clockwise.
C. It shifts vertically upwards by 5 units.
D. It shifts horizontally to the right.

## Question 2
You notice that your regression line fits the data well for small values of $x$, but for large values of $x$, the line is way below the data points. What adjustment is most likely needed?
A. Increase the Slope ($m$).
B. Decrease the Slope ($m$).
C. Decrease the Intercept ($c$).
D. Set the Slope to 0.

## Question 3
Which parameter acts as the "pivot point" for rotation when the slope is changed (assuming the standard equation $y = mx + c$)?
A. The point $(0, 0)$ (Origin).
B. The point $(0, c)$ (Y-intercept).
C. The point $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ (Mean of data).
D. The point $(1, 1)$.
