1. How does increasing the slope affect a line visually?
2. How does increasing the intercept affect a line?
3. Point (4, 20) is above line y = 3x + 5. Calculate the error.
4. Should you increase or decrease slope if points on the right side are consistently below the line?
5. What happens to y = 2x + 10 if you change it to y = 2x + 15?
6. Adjust this line toward point (2, 10): y = 3x + 1
7. Why is it better to make small adjustments rather than large ones?
