# Question Bank: Moving Lines

## Q1 (MCQ)
**Problem:** Which of the following changes represents a "Clockwise Rotation" of the line (making it flatter)?
A. Changing $m$ from 2 to 5.
B. Changing $m$ from 5 to 2.
C. Changing $c$ from 0 to 10.
D. Changing $c$ from 10 to 0.

## Q2 (Coding)
**Problem:** Write a function `shift_line(m, c, shift_amount)` that takes the current slope and intercept, and returns new parameters for a line shifted vertically upwards by `shift_amount`.
**Input:** `m=2, c=1, shift=5`
**Output:** `m=2, c=6`

## Q3 (NAT)
**Problem:** A line starts at $y = 3x + 2$. We want to rotate it so it becomes parallel to the line $y = 5x + 10$. What is the **change** in slope ($\Delta m$) required?

## Q4 (MSQ)
**Problem:** Identify the effects of the following adjustments.
A. Increasing $\theta_0$: Moves line Up.
B. Decreasing $\theta_0$: Moves line Down.
C. Increasing positive $\theta_1$: Makes line Steeper.
D. Decreasing positive $\theta_1$: Makes line Flatter.

## Q5 (Coding)
**Problem:** Simulate a "Pivot".
1.  Define a line $y = mx + c$ passing through $(0, 2)$ with slope 1.
2.  Generate points for this line for $x \in [0, 5]$.
3.  Change the slope to 3, keeping the same intercept. Generate new points.
4.  Print the $y$-value at $x=5$ for both lines to show the difference.

## Q6 (Subjective)
**Problem:** Imagine a seesaw balanced on a fulcrum.
1.  Which parameter corresponds to the height of the fulcrum from the ground?
2.  Which parameter corresponds to the angle of the plank?
3.  If you lift the fulcrum higher but keep the plank angle locked, what happens to the ends of the seesaw?
