# In-Class Quiz

## Question 1
If you have a dataset of 1000 rows and you perform **5-Fold Cross-Validation**, how many times is the model trained and evaluated?
A. 1 time
B. 5 times
C. 10 times
D. 1000 times

## Question 2
Which Cross-Validation strategy is most appropriate for a dataset where the target variable is highly imbalanced (e.g., 90% Class A, 10% Class B)?
A. Standard K-Fold
B. Stratified K-Fold
C. Leave-One-Out
D. Random Split

## Question 3
Why can't we use standard K-Fold Cross-Validation for Time Series data (e.g., predicting stock prices)?
A. Because time series data is not numerical.
B. Because it would involve training on future data to predict past data (Data Leakage).
C. Because stock prices change too fast.
D. Because K-Fold only works for images.
