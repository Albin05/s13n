## Question 1
Which of the following is NOT a benefit of performing Feature Selection?
A. Reduced training time.
B. Reduced chance of overfitting.
C. Increased model complexity.
D. Improved model interpretability.

## Question 2

A. Wrapper Method
B. Filter Method
C. Embedded Method
D. Neural Network Method

## Question 3
