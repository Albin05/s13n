# In-Class Quiz

## Question 1
One-Hot Encoding is most appropriate for which type of data?
A. Ordinal Categorical Data (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
B. Nominal Categorical Data (e.g., Apple, Banana, Cherry).
C. Continuous Numerical Data (e.g., Temperature).
D. Time Series Data.

## Question 2
If you One-Hot Encode a feature "Day of Week" (Monday through Sunday) and you want to avoid the "Dummy Variable Trap", how many new columns should you generate?
A. 1
B. 6
C. 7
D. 0

## Question 3
What is the main disadvantage of using One-Hot Encoding on a feature with very high cardinality (e.g., a "User ID" column with 10,000 unique users)?
A. It introduces bias.
B. It makes the model overfit to the order of data.
C. It massively increases the number of features (dimensions), leading to slower training and high memory usage.
D. It converts numbers to text.
