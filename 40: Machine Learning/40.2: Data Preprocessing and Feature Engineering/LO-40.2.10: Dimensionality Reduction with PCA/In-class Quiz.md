# In-Class Quiz

## Question 1
What is the primary goal of PCA?
A. To increase the number of features to capture more detail.
B. To classify data into clusters.
C. To reduce the number of features while maximizing the preserved variance.
D. To normalize the data range between 0 and 1.

## Question 2
Why is **Standardization** (scaling) highly recommended before applying PCA?
A. PCA cannot handle negative numbers.
B. PCA is sensitive to the scale of features; large magnitude features would dominate the variance.
C. It converts categorical data to numerical.
D. It increases the number of rows in the dataset.

## Question 3
If the first Principal Component (PC1) has an "Explained Variance Ratio" of 0.85, what does this mean?
A. It contains 85% of the features from the original dataset.
B. It captures 85% of the information (variance) present in the original dataset.
C. It is 85% accurate in predicting the target variable.
D. It has a correlation of 0.85 with the target.
