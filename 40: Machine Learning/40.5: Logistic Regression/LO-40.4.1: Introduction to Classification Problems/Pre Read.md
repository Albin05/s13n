# Introduction to Classification

## Conceptual Explanation
Classification is a subcategory of Supervised Learning where the objective is to predict the categorical class label of a new observation based on past observations. Unlike regression, where the output is a continuous number (like price or height), classification outputs a discrete group or "class."

If the data can be separated into two distinct groups, it is called **Binary Classification**. If there are more than two groups, it is called **Multi-class Classification**.

## Short Examples
1.  **Credit Approval:** A bank decides whether to approve (Class 1) or reject (Class 0) a loan application based on credit history.
2.  **Image Recognition:** A computer program identifies whether a photo contains a cat, a dog, or a horse (Multi-class).
3.  **Medical Diagnosis:** Determining if a tumor is benign or malignant.
