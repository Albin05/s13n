**Questions:**

1. Find the null values in different columns. Do not drop the null values, fill it up with the appropriate values.
2. Check the data types of each column and change them accordingly. You can drop the noise values.
3. Create a new column “P-BMI” in which values would be in “yes” and “no” form, if sum of values of “bmi” is even then “yes” else “no”
4. Find the 5-point summary of the numerical columns (eg. Age, BMI, Children, Charges)
5. Find the different unique values in each categorical column.
6. Create a correlation heatmap to check the correlation of different variables with each
other.
7. Create a scatter plot of the target variable (price) against the variable "age”
8. Apply the scaling on numerical columns and encode the categorical ones.
9. Train the linear regression model with the help of all given columns.
10. Determine the training and testing accuracy.
11. Interpret the results of the evaluation metrics and comment on the performance of
the linear regression model.
