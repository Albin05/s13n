# Real-world Classification Examples

## Conceptual Explanation
Classification is not just a theoretical concept; it is the engine behind many everyday technologies. Whenever software makes a discrete decision or categorizes information, a classification model is likely at work. 

While the underlying math (which we will explore via Logistic Regression) remains consistent, the applications vary wildly depending on what the **features** ($X$) and **target labels** ($y$) represent. Common application domains include Cybersecurity, Healthcare, Finance, and Natural Language Processing.

## Short Examples
* **Finance:** A bank's system classifies a swipe of a credit card in a foreign country as "Fraudulent" or "Legitimate".
* **E-commerce:** A system categorizes customer support tickets into "Billing Issue", "Technical Support", or "Feedback" to route them to the right department.
* **Healthcare:** An AI analyzes an X-ray to classify a bone as "Fractured" or "Not Fractured".
