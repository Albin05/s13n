## Section D: Long Answer / Application Questions

**Q5.** In the context of machine learning, if we have a linear equation $z = \theta^T x$ that can output any real number from $-\infty$ to $\infty$, why is passing it through an exponential function $e^z$ a useful first step toward converting it into a probability?
