# In-class Quiz: The Logistic Equation

## Question 1
Which of the following correctly describes how the Logistic Regression hypothesis is formed?
A. By adding the Sigmoid function to the cost function.
B. By multiplying the Linear Regression hypothesis by $e^{-z}$.
C. By passing the linear combination of inputs and weights into the Sigmoid function.
D. By replacing the weights ($\theta$) with the mathematical constant $e$.

## Question 2
If the Logistic Regression hypothesis $h_\theta(x)$ outputs a value of $0.8$, what does this mathematically represent?
A. An $80\%$ error rate.
B. The probability that the data point belongs to Class 0 is $80\%$.
C. The probability that the data point belongs to Class 1 is $80\%$.
D. The linear boundary equation equals $0.8$.

## Question 3

A. Apply a natural logarithm.
B. Apply a decision threshold.
C. Multiply by $100$.
D. Calculate the derivative.
