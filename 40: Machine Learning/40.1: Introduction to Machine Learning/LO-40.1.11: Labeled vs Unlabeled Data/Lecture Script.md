### Main Content (18 min)
**Labeled Data (6 min)**
- Definition: Data + known answers
- Flashcard analogy
- Dog/Cat example with features
- Why needed: Teaching the model

**Unlabeled Data (5 min)**
- Definition: Data without answers
- What we predict on
- New email example
- Real goal of ML

**The Challenge (7 min)**
- Getting labeled data is hard
- Costs time and money
- Example: 100k images = 277 hours
- Solutions: crowdsourcing, active learning
- ML flow: Labeled trains, Unlabeled predicts

### Exercise (2 min)
"For predicting student grades:
- Give example of labeled data
- Give example of unlabeled data"

### Wrap-up (2 min)
- Labeled = training (expensive)
- Unlabeled = prediction (easy)
- Need both for ML
- Challenge: getting labels
