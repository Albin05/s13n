
## Concept
In Machine Learning, data is the fuel. However, not all data is created equal. The most fundamental distinction in datasets is whether they are **Labeled** or **Unlabeled**.

* **Unlabeled Data:** Raw data that consists of samples (inputs) but has no accompanying explanation, tag, or "answer."
* **Labeled Data:** Data that comes with a tag, name, or "target" that explains what the data represents.

## Real-World Example
Imagine you have a folder of 1,000 photos of animals.
* **Unlabeled:** You have the photos, but you don't know what animals are in them. A computer sees a grid of pixels.
* **Labeled:** Each photo has a filename like `cat_01.jpg`, `dog_04.jpg`, or a spreadsheet attached that says "Photo 1 is a Cat."
