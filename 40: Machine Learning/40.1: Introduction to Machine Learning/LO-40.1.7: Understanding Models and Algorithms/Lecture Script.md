### Hook (3 min)
Ask: "When you decide if an email is spam, what do you look for?"
Get responses: "FREE", "typos", "suspicious links"
Say: "These are FEATURES! Today we learn how models use features."

### Main Content (18 min)
**Models (6 min)**
- Define: Set of rules for predictions
- Example: Spam detection rule
- Show: Model can be wrong but still useful

**Algorithms (4 min)**
- Define: Process to build model
- Analogy: Recipe vs cooking process
- Relationship: Algorithm creates model

**Features & Labels (8 min)**
- Features: Input properties (x)
- Labels: Output we predict (y)
- Example: Build spam model with multiple features
- Demo: Show how more features can improve model

### Exercise (2 min)
"List 3 features for predicting if it will rain tomorrow"
Share answers

### Wrap-up (2 min)
Key points:
- Algorithm builds the model
- Model uses features to predict labels
- Quality features = better predictions
