# Question Bank: Models vs Algorithms

## Q1 (MCQ)
**Problem:** Which of the following is an example of an **Algorithm** (not a Model)?
A. A file containing the weights of a neural network.
B. The mathematical procedure "Gradient Descent".
C. A spam filter that has already learned to block "Viagra".
D. The prediction "This image is a cat".

## Q2 (Coding)
**Problem:** You are given a class `Algorithm` with a method `train(data)` that returns a `Model` object. The `Model` object has a method `predict(input)`. Write a script that instantiates the algorithm, trains it on `[1, 2, 3]`, and predicts on `4`.

## Q3 (NAT)
**Problem:** An algorithm has 2 hyperparameters (settings). It learns 5 parameters (weights) from the data to create a model. If we train this algorithm 3 times on different datasets, how many total unique **Model Parameters** will exist across all 3 resulting models?

## Q4 (MSQ)
**Problem:** Which of the following statements are TRUE?
A. The Algorithm is the code; the Model is the data structure containing the learned patterns.
B. You typically deploy the Algorithm to production, not the Model.
C. A "Pre-trained Model" means someone else has already run the Algorithm on their data.
D. Changing the training data changes the Algorithm.

## Q5 (Coding)
**Problem:** Simulate the difference.
1.  Define a function `algorithm(data)` that calculates the average.
2.  Run it on `data1 = [10, 20]` to get `model1`.
3.  Run it on `data2 = [30, 40]` to get `model2`.
4.  Print the values of both models to show they are different.

## Q6 (Subjective)
**Problem:** Explain the relationship between Data, Algorithm, and Model using the analogy of a **Key Maker**. Who is the machine, what is the blank key, and what is the final key?
