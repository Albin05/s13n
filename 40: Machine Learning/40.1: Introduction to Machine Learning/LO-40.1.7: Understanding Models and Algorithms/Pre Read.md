# Understanding Models and Algorithms

## Concept
In Machine Learning, the terms "Algorithm" and "Model" are often used interchangeably, but they refer to two distinct parts of the process.

* **Algorithm:** The "procedure" or the "engine." It is the mathematical logic used to find patterns in data. It is generic and exists before you have any data (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree).
* **Model:** The "result" or the "artifact." It is the specific representation of what the machine learned from *your* specific data. It consists of the specific numbers (weights) and structure found by the algorithm.

## Real-World Analogy: Baking a Cake
* **Algorithm = The Recipe:** It tells you *how* to bake. It is a set of instructions. You can use the same recipe to bake a chocolate cake or a vanilla cake depending on the ingredients.
* **Data = The Ingredients:** Flour, sugar, cocoa powder.
* **Model = The Cake:** The final product that comes out of the oven. You eat the cake (Use the Model), not the recipe.

## The Equation
$$Data + Algorithm = Model$$
