# Understanding Models and Algorithms

## Key Definitions
1.  **Machine Learning Algorithm:** A procedure or method run on data to create a model. It is the logic of *learning*.
2.  **Machine Learning Model:** The output of a machine learning algorithm run on data. It is the logic of *prediction*.

## Comparative Table

| Feature | Algorithm | Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | The Teacher / The Method | The Student / The Result |
| **Nature** | Generic / Static code | Specific / Dynamic weights |
| **Input** | Training Data | New Data (for prediction) |
| **Output** | A Model | A Prediction |
| **Analogy** | The Compiler | The Executable Program (`.exe`) |
| **Examples** | Linear Regression, Decision Tree | The equation $y=3x+2$, A specific decision tree structure |

## The Lifecycle
1.  **Selection:** Choose an **Algorithm** (e.g., Random Forest).
2.  **Training:** Feed **Data** into the Algorithm.
3.  **Result:** A **Model** is generated (saved as a file, e.g., `model.pkl`).
4.  **Inference:** The **Model** predicts outcomes for new users.
