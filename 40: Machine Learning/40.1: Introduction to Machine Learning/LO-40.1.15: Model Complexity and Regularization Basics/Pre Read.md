# Model Complexity and Regularization Basics

## Concept
In Machine Learning, we often face a problem where our model becomes *too* good at learning the training data—so good that it memorizes noise and fails on new data (Overfitting). This happens when the model is too **Complex**.

**Regularization** is a technique used to constrain or "penalize" this complexity. It discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns by adding a penalty term to the Loss Function.

## Analogy: Occam's Razor
Imagine you are a detective trying to solve a crime.
* **Complex Theory:** "The suspect flew in on a jetpack, used a laser through the window, and escaped via submarine." (Fits the facts but highly unlikely/complex).
* **Simple Theory:** "The suspect walked in the open door." (Fits the facts and is simple).
* **Regularization:** A rule that says "Unless you have strong evidence, prefer the Simple Theory."
