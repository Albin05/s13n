## Question 1
What is the primary purpose of adding a Regularization term to the loss function?
A. To minimize the training error to zero.
B. To increase the complexity of the model.
C. To prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights.
D. To allow the model to learn faster.

## Question 2
Which type of regularization is capable of driving coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing feature selection?
A. L1 Regularization (Lasso)
B. L2 Regularization (Ridge)
C. Dropout
D. Data Augmentation

## Question 3
If you set the regularization parameter $\lambda$ (or alpha) to a very large number, what is the likely outcome?
A. The model will overfit.
B. The model will underfit.
C. The model will have perfect accuracy.
D. The training time will increase significantly.
