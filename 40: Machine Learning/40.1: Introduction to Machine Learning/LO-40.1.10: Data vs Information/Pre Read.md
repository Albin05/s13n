# Data vs Information

## Concept
In the realm of Machine Learning and Computer Science, **Data** and **Information** are distinct concepts often used interchangeably in casual conversation.

* **Data** refers to raw, unorganized facts, figures, and symbols. It has no context and, on its own, provides little value to decision-making.
* **Information** is data that has been processed, organized, structured, or presented in a given context to make it useful.

## Real-World Example
Consider a weather station sensor.
* **Data:** A stream of numbers: `25, 26, 24, 28, 90`. Without context, we don't know if this is temperature, humidity, or wind speed.
* **Information:** "The temperature in the city over the last 5 hours averaged 26°C with 90% humidity."
