# Understanding Labels and Predictions

## Concept
In Supervised Machine Learning, we deal with two critical concepts that often look similar but serve opposite roles:

1.  **The Label ($y$):** This is the "Ground Truth" or the "Correct Answer." It exists in historical data and is used to teach the model.
2.  **The Prediction ($\hat{y}$):** This is the "Model's Guess." It is the output generated by the machine.

## The Goal
The entire goal of training a machine learning model is to make the **Prediction** ($\hat{y}$) as close as possible to the **Label** ($y$). The difference between them is called the **Error**.

## Real-World Analogy: The Exam
* **The Question:** The Input Data (Features).
* **The Prediction:** The answer you write on the test paper.
* **The Label:** The answer key held by the teacher.
* **The Score:** How well your Prediction matched the Label.
