A. Bias increases, Variance increases.
B. Bias decreases, Variance decreases.
C. Bias decreases, Variance increases.
D. Bias increases, Variance decreases.

## Question 2

B. A student who consistently answers "C" on every multiple-choice question regardless of the content.
C. A student who understands the concepts perfectly.
D. A student whose grades fluctuate wildly depending on the specific questions asked.

## Question 3
The "Irreducible Error" in the Bias-Variance decomposition represents:
A. The error caused by bad code.
B. The noise in the data itself that no model can predict.
C. The error caused by choosing the wrong algorithm.
D. The computational limit of the CPU.
