# Decision Making - Logic vs Experience

## Concept
Humans and machines make decisions using two primary methods:
1.  **Logic (Rule-Based):** Explicit reasoning using defined rules, facts, and "if-then" statements. This is transparent and precise but rigid.
2.  **Experience (Data-Driven):** Implicit reasoning based on patterns observed in past examples. This is flexible and handles ambiguity well but can be opaque.

**Machine Learning** is essentially the shift from Logic-based decision making (Traditional Programming) to Experience-based decision making (Learning from Data).

## Real-World Analogy: Learning a Language
* **Logic Approach:** You study a grammar textbook. You memorize rules like "Subject + Verb + Object." You consciously construct sentences. This is slow and fails with slang or idioms.
* **Experience Approach:** You move to the country and listen to people speak for a year. You eventually "feel" what sounds right without knowing the exact grammar rule. This is how ML works.
