# Decision Making - Logic vs Experience

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Logic (Rule-Based) | Experience (Data-Driven) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Mechanism** | Explicit Rules (If-Then) | Statistical Patterns |
| **Creation** | Programmed by humans | Learned from data |
| **Adaptability** | Low (Must rewrite code) | High (Retrain with new data) |
| **Explainability** | High (White Box) | Low (Black Box) |
| **Best Use Case** | Compliance, Math, Physics | Perception, Prediction, Recommendations |

## The Hybrid Approach
Modern systems often combine both.
* **Example:** Self-Driving Cars.
    * **Experience:** Recognizing a pedestrian (ML/Vision).
    * **Logic:** Stopping at a red light (Rule: `if light == RED: stop`).

## Inductive vs Deductive
* **Deductive (Logic):** General Rule $\to$ Specific Conclusion.
    * *All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.*
* **Inductive (Experience):** Specific Observations $\to$ General Rule.
    * *Socrates died. Plato died. Aristotle died. Therefore, all men are likely mortal.*
