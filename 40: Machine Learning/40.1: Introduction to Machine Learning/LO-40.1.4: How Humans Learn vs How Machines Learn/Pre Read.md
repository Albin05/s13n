# How Humans Learn vs How Machines Learn

## Concept
While Machine Learning is inspired by the human brain, the actual mechanisms differ significantly.
* **Human Learning:** Driven by cognitive reasoning, intuition, and experience. We are excellent at **Few-Shot Learning** (learning from very few examples).
* **Machine Learning:** Driven by statistical optimization and math. Machines are excellent at **Pattern Recognition** in massive datasets but generally require thousands of examples to learn what a human learns in one.

## Real-World Analogy: Recognizing a Dog
* **Human:** A parent points to a Golden Retriever and says "Dog." The child immediately understands the concept of "Dog" and can recognize a Chihuahua as a dog too, despite the size difference.
* **Machine:** To recognize a dog, a computer needs to see thousands of images of different breeds, angles, and lighting conditions to mathematically define the "features" of a dog.

## Key Differences
1.  **Data Efficiency:** Humans need little data; Machines need lots.
2.  **Transfer Learning:** Humans easily apply knowledge from one domain to another (e.g., knowing how to run helps with soccer). Machines struggle to transfer context.
3.  **Compute:** Humans consume ~20 Watts of power. Machines training large models can consume MegaWatts.
