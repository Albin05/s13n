# Question Bank: Human vs Machine Learning

## Q1 (MCQ)
**Problem:** A machine learning model requires 10,000 labeled images to recognize a "Stop Sign" with 95% accuracy. A human driver requires seeing a Stop Sign once in a driver's manual. This illustrates the difference in:
A. Computing Power
B. Data Efficiency
C. Storage Capacity
D. Algorithmic Complexity

## Q2 (Coding)
**Problem:** Machines learn by updating their "weights" to reduce error. Write a function `update_weight(w, error, learning_rate)` that returns the new weight. Formula: $w_{new} = w_{old} + (error \times rate)$.
**Input:** `w=0.5`, `error=0.2`, `rate=0.1`
**Output:** `0.52`

## Q3 (NAT)
**Problem:** A machine makes a guess of 50. The true value is 100. The machine improves its guess by 10% of the error in each step. What is the machine's guess after Step 1?

## Q4 (MSQ)
**Problem:** Which of the following are characteristics of **Machine Learning** (as opposed to Human Learning)?
A. Requires explicit mathematical definition of "Error".
B. Capable of intuition and "gut feelings".
C. Performance generally improves with more data.
D. Can learn complex abstract concepts from a single story.

## Q5 (Coding)
**Problem:** Simulate a machine "forgetting". Write a function where a learned value degrades by 10% every time the function `passage_of_time()` is called, unless `reinforce()` is called to reset it to 100%.

## Q6 (Subjective)
**Problem:** Explain the concept of "Context" in learning. Why can a human understand the sentence "The bat flew out of the cave" vs "He hit the ball with the bat" instantly, while a machine might struggle without specific training on homonyms?
