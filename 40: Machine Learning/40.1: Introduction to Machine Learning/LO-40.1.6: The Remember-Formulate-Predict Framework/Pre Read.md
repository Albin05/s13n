# The Remember-Formulate-Predict Framework

## Concept
To understand how Machine Learning works without getting lost in complex math, we can break it down into a simple three-step mental model: **Remember, Formulate, Predict**.

1.  **Remember (Input Data):** The machine stores a vast amount of past experiences or examples. In ML terms, this is the **Dataset**.
2.  **Formulate (Model Building):** The machine analyzes the stored data to find patterns and creates a general rule or formula. In ML terms, this is **Training**.
3.  **Predict (Output):** The machine uses the formulated rule to make decisions on new, unseen data. In ML terms, this is **Inference**.

## Real-World Analogy: Studying for an Exam
* **Remember:** You read the textbook and memorize practice questions (Data Collection).
* **Formulate:** You understand the underlying concepts and figure out how to solve similar problems (Learning the logic/Model).
* **Predict:** You sit in the exam hall, see a new question, and use your understanding to write the answer (Testing).
