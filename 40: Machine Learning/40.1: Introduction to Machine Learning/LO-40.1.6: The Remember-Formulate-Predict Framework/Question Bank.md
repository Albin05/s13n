# Question Bank: Remember-Formulate-Predict

## Q1 (MCQ)
**Problem:** Which component constitutes the "Remember" phase in a supervised learning task?
A. The Learning Rate.
B. The Labeled Dataset.
C. The Loss Function.
D. The Prediction Output.

## Q2 (Coding)
**Problem:** You have "Remembered" two data points: `(2, 4)` and `(4, 8)`. Write a function `formulate()` that calculates the slope `m` (assuming $y = mx$) and returns a `predict(x)` function that uses this slope.

## Q3 (NAT)
**Problem:** A system "Remembers" 1000 user clicks. It takes 500ms to "Formulate" a pattern from these clicks. Once formulated, it takes 2ms to "Predict" the next click. If we need to make 50 predictions after one formulation cycle, what is the total time in milliseconds?

## Q4 (MSQ)
**Problem:** Which of the following scenarios describe a failure in the **Formulate** step?
A. The model captures the noise in the data instead of the signal (Overfitting).
B. The model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern (Underfitting).
C. The dataset contains incorrect labels (Garbage Data).
D. The prediction server is offline.

## Q5 (Coding)
**Problem:** Implement the framework using a dictionary.
1.  **Remember:** Store `{'sunny': 'play', 'rainy': 'stay'}`.
2.  **Formulate:** Create a function that looks up the weather.
3.  **Predict:** Return the action for 'sunny' and 'snowy' (default to 'unknown').

## Q6 (Subjective)
**Problem:** Explain why "Formulate" is more valuable than just "Remember". Use the example of a self-driving car encountering a pedestrian in a yellow jacket for the first time, when it has only seen pedestrians in red and blue jackets before.
