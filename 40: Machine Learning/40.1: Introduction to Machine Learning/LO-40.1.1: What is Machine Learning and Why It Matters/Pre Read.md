# What is Machine Learning?

## Concept
**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed with rules for every possible scenario, an ML system uses data to identify patterns and make decisions.

## Traditional Programming vs. Machine Learning
* **Traditional Programming:** You write the rules (logic) and input data. The computer gives you answers.
    * *Input:* `Data` + `Rules` → *Output:* `Answers`
* **Machine Learning:** You input data and the correct answers (history). The computer gives you the rules.
    * *Input:* `Data` + `Answers` → *Output:* `Rules` (Model)

## Real-World Analogy
Think about teaching a child to identify an apple.
* **Traditional Approach:** You try to describe it perfectly: "It's red, round, has a stem, is a fruit..." (This fails for green apples or pictures of red balls).
* **ML Approach:** You show the child 100 pictures of apples and say "This is an apple." The child's brain figures out the patterns (shape, texture, context) on its own.
