# Question Bank: What is Machine Learning and Why It Matters

## Question 1 (MCQ - Easy)

What is the fundamental difference between traditional programming and Machine Learning?

A) Traditional programming is faster than Machine Learning
B) Traditional programming uses data and explicit rules to produce results, while Machine Learning uses data and examples to learn rules
C) Machine Learning doesn't require computers to execute
D) Traditional programming can't handle mathematical calculations

**Correct Answer**: B

**Difficulty**: Easy

## Question 2 (MCQ - Medium)

A company wants to build a system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The system needs to analyze millions of transactions daily and adapt to new fraud patterns as they emerge. Which of the following statements is TRUE about why Machine Learning is appropriate for this task?

A) ML is chosen because it requires less computing power than traditional programming
B) ML is appropriate because fraud patterns are simple and can be easily coded with fixed rules
C) ML is suitable because it can learn from data, identify complex patterns, and adapt to evolving fraud tactics
D) ML is necessary because traditional programming cannot process large amounts of data

**Correct Answer**: C

**Difficulty**: Medium

## Question 3 (Subjective - Medium)

Explain in your own words why Machine Learning is considered a "paradigm shift" from traditional programming. Provide a real-world example where ML would be more effective than traditional programming, and explain why.

**Expected Length**: 150-200 words

**Key Points to Cover**:
- Definition of paradigm shift in this context
- How ML changes the approach to problem-solving
- A clear real-world example
- Explanation of why ML is more suitable for that example

## Question 4 (Subjective - Medium to Hard)

You are tasked with building two different systems:

**System A**: A calculator that computes the monthly payment for a loan given principal amount, interest rate, and loan term.

**System B**: A system that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan based on their financial history, employment status, credit score, and other factors.

For each system, justify whether you would use traditional programming or Machine Learning. Explain your reasoning with at least three specific points for each system.

**Expected Length**: 250-300 words

**Key Points to Cover**:
- Clear recommendation for each system
- Specific technical justification
- Discussion of data requirements
- Consideration of complexity
- Mention of accuracy/adaptability needs

## Question 5 (Code-Based/Analytical - Hard)

Consider the following scenario: You have a dataset of 10,000 emails, each labeled as "spam" or "not spam". Each email has been processed to extract the following features:

- Number of words in the email
- Presence of words like "free", "winner", "click here" (yes/no)
- Number of exclamation marks
- Sender domain (gmail.com, yahoo.com, unknown, etc.)
- Time of day sent

**Part A**: Describe conceptually how a Machine Learning approach would use this data to build a spam detection model. What is the model learning, and how would it make predictions on new emails?

**Part B**: Would a traditional programming approach (with fixed rules) be effective for this task? Why or why not? Provide at least two specific limitations of the rule-based approach.

**Part C**: As new spam tactics emerge (e.g., spammers stop using words like "free" and start using more sophisticated language), how would the ML approach handle this compared to the traditional approach?

**Expected Length**: 400-500 words total

**Key Points to Cover**:
- Understanding of how ML learns from labeled data
- Concept of pattern recognition and prediction
- Clear comparison between ML and rule-based approaches
- Discussion of adaptability and scalability
- Specific examples related to the spam detection scenario
