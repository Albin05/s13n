# Question Bank: What is Machine Learning?

## Q1 (MCQ)
**Problem:** Which statement best describes the relationship between AI and ML?
A. ML is a subset of AI.
B. AI is a subset of ML.
C. AI and ML are exactly the same thing.
D. AI and ML are unrelated fields.

## Q2 (Coding)
**Problem:** Write a Python function `predict_rule(x)` that mimics a simple learned model. The model has "learned" that $y = 2x + 1$.
**Input:** An integer `x`.
**Output:** Return the predicted `y`.

## Q3 (NAT)
**Problem:** A spam filter looks at 1000 emails. It identifies 900 correctly as Spam or Not Spam. What is the accuracy percentage of this ML model?

## Q4 (MSQ)
**Problem:** Select all scenarios where Machine Learning is **essential** (Traditional programming would fail or be extremely difficult).
A. Recognizing handwritten digits (0-9).
B. Calculating the area of a circle given the radius.
C. Recommending a YouTube video based on watch history.
D. Finding the shortest path in a graph (Dijkstra's Algorithm).

## Q5 (Coding)
**Problem:** You have a dataset of house sizes and prices.
`sizes = [1000, 1500, 2000]`, `prices = [200, 300, 400]`.
Write a function that "learns" the price per sq ft (simple division of averages) and predicts the price of a 2500 sq ft house.

## Q6 (Subjective)
**Problem:** Explain the phrase "Machine Learning allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed." Use the example of a spam filter to illustrate the difference between the "explicitly programmed" approach and the "ML" approach.
