# What is Machine Learning?

## Definition
Machine Learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.

## The Paradigm Shift
| Feature | Traditional Programming | Machine Learning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input** | Rules + Data | Data + Answers |
| **Output** | Answers | Rules (Model) |
| **Focus** | Logic & Syntax | Statistics & Patterns |
| **Best For** | Exact calculations, Fixed rules | Perception, Prediction, Complex patterns |

## Why It Matters
1.  **Scale:** Can handle petabytes of data that humans cannot analyze.
2.  **Complexity:** Can solve problems where rules are hard to define (e.g., Face Recognition).
3.  **Adaptability:** Models can retrain on new data to adapt to changing environments.

## Examples in Daily Life
* **Netflix/Spotify:** Recommendation engines ("Because you liked X...").
* **Email:** Spam filters.
* **Banking:** Fraud detection systems.
* **Voice Assistants:** Siri/Alexa (Speech-to-Text).
