## Question 1 (MCQ)

In Machine Learning, what do we provide to the algorithm during the training process?

A) Explicit rules and logic
B) Data and examples with known outcomes
C) Only the final predictions
D) Hardware specifications

**Correct Answer**: B

---

## Question 2 (MCQ)

Which of the following problems is MOST suitable for a Machine Learning approach?

A) Calculating the sum of two numbers
B) Converting miles to kilometers
C) Recognizing handwritten digits from images
D) Sorting a list of numbers in ascending order

**Correct Answer**: C

---

## Question 3 (Short Answer)

List three reasons why Machine Learning matters in today's world. Provide one specific example for any one of your reasons.

**Expected Answer (Key Points)**:
- Handles complexity (e.g., facial recognition, image classification)
- Adapts to change (e.g., spam detection with evolving tactics)
- Discovers hidden patterns (e.g., disease detection from medical images)
- Personalization at scale (e.g., Netflix recommendations)
- Automation and efficiency (e.g., chatbots for customer support)

Students should list 3 reasons and provide 1 concrete example.

## Question 4 (MCQ)

What is the main advantage of Machine Learning over traditional rule-based programming when dealing with spam email detection?

A) ML uses less memory than traditional programs
B) ML doesn't require any data to work
C) ML can adapt to new spam patterns by retraining with new data
D) ML executes faster than traditional programs

**Correct Answer**: C

---

## Question 5 (Short Answer)

Give one example of a situation where traditional programming would be MORE appropriate than Machine Learning, and briefly explain why.

**Expected Answer (Key Points)**:
Students should identify scenarios where:
- Rules are simple and well-defined (e.g., basic arithmetic, formula-based calculations)
- Perfect accuracy is required
- No data is available
- The relationship between inputs and outputs is mathematically defined

Example: "Calculating loan payments using a fixed formula is better with traditional programming because the formula is exact, accuracy must be perfect, and no learning from data is needed."

**Answer Key Summary**:
1. B
2. C
3. Three reasons + one example (open-ended)
4. C
5. One appropriate scenario with explanation (open-ended)
