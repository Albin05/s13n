# Understanding AI, ML, and Deep Learning Hierarchy

## Concept
The terms Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) are often used interchangeably, but they represent distinct levels of a hierarchy. Think of them as Russian nesting dolls or concentric circles.

1.  **Artificial Intelligence (The Largest Circle):** Any technique that enables computers to mimic human intelligence. This includes simple `if-else` logic (Rule-based AI) as well as complex learning systems.
2.  **Machine Learning (The Inner Circle):** A subset of AI. It refers to systems that can learn from data patterns without being explicitly programmed with rules.
3.  **Deep Learning (The Core):** A subset of ML. It uses "Artificial Neural Networks" with many layers (hence "Deep") to solve complex problems like image recognition and natural language processing.

## Real-World Analogy
* **AI:** A vehicle (Anything that moves you).
* **ML:** A car (A specific type of vehicle with an engine).
* **DL:** A Ferrari (A specific, high-performance type of car).

Every Ferrari is a car, and every car is a vehicle. But not every vehicle is a car (some are bikes), and not every car is a Ferrari.
