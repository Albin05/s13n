# AI, ML, and Deep Learning Hierarchy

## The Hierarchy (Concentric Circles)
1.  **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The broad discipline of creating intelligent machines.
2.  **Machine Learning (ML):** The subset of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data.
3.  **Deep Learning (DL):** The subset of ML focused on multi-layered neural networks.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Machine Learning (ML) | Deep Learning (DL) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Origin** | 1950s | 1980s | 2010s (Boom) |
| **Logic** | Rule-based or Learning-based | Statistical Patterns | Neural Architecture |
| **Data Need** | Can be low (for rules) | Medium | Massive |
| **Hardware** | CPU | CPU | GPU / TPU |
| **Example** | Deep Blue (Chess) | Spam Filter | Self-Driving Cars |

## Key Differences
* **Feature Extraction:**
    * **ML:** Humans must manually extract features (e.g., define "roundness" to detect apples).
    * **DL:** The network automatically learns features from raw data (pixels/audio).
* **Performance:**
    * **ML:** Plateaus with more data.
    * **DL:** Performance continues to improve as data increases.
