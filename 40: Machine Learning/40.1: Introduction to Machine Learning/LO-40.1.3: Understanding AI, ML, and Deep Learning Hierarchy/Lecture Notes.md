# Understanding AI, ML, and Deep Learning Hierarchy

## Defining the Three Concepts

### What is Artificial Intelligence?

The set of all tasks in which a computer can make decisions.

AI is the broadest category - it encompasses any system where computers can make intelligent decisions.

### What is Machine Learning?

The set of all tasks in which a computer can make decisions **based on data**.

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.

### What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is actually a part of Machine Learning.

We have several techniques to get computers to learn from data. One technique has been performing tremendously well, so it has its own field of study called **deep learning (DL)**.

If we are looking at cutting-edge applications like:
- Image recognition
- Text generation
- Playing Go
- Self-driving cars

Very likely we are looking at deep learning in some way.

Think of it like nested circles:
- **AI** is the outer circle (all computer decision-making)
- **ML** is inside AI (decision-making from data)
- **DL** is inside ML (using deep neural networks)

## Key Distinctions

| Concept | Scope | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| AI | Any intelligent computer behavior | Chess-playing program using rules |
| ML | Learning from data | Spam filter that improves over time |
| DL | Learning using neural networks | Face recognition in photos |

## Remember

- All ML is AI, but not all AI is ML
- All DL is ML, but not all ML is DL
- Each layer adds more capability but also more complexity
