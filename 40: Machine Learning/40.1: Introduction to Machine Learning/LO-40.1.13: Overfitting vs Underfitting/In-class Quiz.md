## Question 1
A model achieves 99% accuracy on the training set but only 55% accuracy on the test set. This is a classic example of:
A. Underfitting
B. Overfitting
C. Good Fitting
D. Data Leakage

## Question 2
Which of the following actions is most likely to fix **Underfitting**?
A. Removing features from the dataset.
B. Adding more data samples (rows).
C. Increasing the complexity of the model (e.g., increasing polynomial degree).
D. Applying Regularization.

## Question 3
In a graph of "Model Complexity" (x-axis) vs "Error" (y-axis), what generally happens to the **Training Error** as complexity increases?
A. It decreases continuously.
B. It increases continuously.
C. It decreases then increases (U-shape).
D. It stays constant.
