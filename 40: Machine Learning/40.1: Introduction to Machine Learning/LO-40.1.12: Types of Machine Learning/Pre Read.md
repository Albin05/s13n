# Types of Machine Learning

## Concept
Machine Learning is not a single technique but a collection of methods, generally categorized by how the system learns from data. The three primary pillars are:

1.  **Supervised Learning:** The model learns from labeled data (input-output pairs). It's like learning with a teacher who corrects your answers.
2.  **Unsupervised Learning:** The model learns from unlabeled data. It tries to find hidden patterns or structures on its own. It's like self-study without an answer key.
3.  **Reinforcement Learning:** The model learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for actions. It's like training a dog with treats.

## Real-World Examples
* **Supervised:** Email Spam Filters (labeled "Spam" or "Not Spam").
* **Unsupervised:** Customer Segmentation (grouping similar purchasing habits).
* **Reinforcement:** A robot learning to walk (falling = penalty, moving forward = reward).
