# Question Bank: Types of Machine Learning

## Q1 (MCQ)
**Problem:** Which algorithm type typically does NOT require a target variable ($y$) during training?
A. Linear Regression
B. K-Means Clustering
C. Logistic Regression
D. Decision Trees

## Q2 (Coding)
**Problem:** You are given a function `train_model(data, labels=None)`. Write a wrapper function that calls this. If `labels` are provided, print "Starting Supervised Training". If `labels` are `None`, print "Starting Unsupervised Training".

## Q3 (NAT)
**Problem:** In a Reinforcement Learning scenario, an agent receives +10 points for a win, -1 for a step, and -50 for a loss. If the agent takes 15 steps and then wins, what is the total reward?

## Q4 (MSQ)
**Problem:** Select all scenarios that are best solved using **Supervised Learning**.
A. Predicting house prices based on square footage and location.
B. Grouping customers by purchasing behavior to find market segments.
C. Diagnosing a disease (Yes/No) based on medical test results and past patient history.
D. Teaching a car to drive by letting it crash in a simulator millions of times.

## Q5 (Coding)
**Problem:** Classify the following scenarios into 'Supervised', 'Unsupervised', or 'RL' using a Python dictionary mapping.
* Scenario A: "Predicting rain (Yes/No) using historical weather data."
* Scenario B: "Organizing a library of books into genres without knowing the genres beforehand."
* Scenario C: "A chess bot learning from playing against itself."

**Output:** A dictionary `{'A': '...', 'B': '...', 'C': '...'}`

## Q6 (Subjective)
**Problem:** Explain why "Fraud Detection" in banking can be modeled as both a Supervised Learning problem AND an Unsupervised Learning problem. How does the approach differ?
