# ML Assignment 11 (Bagging and Boosting)

### **Part A:**

1. What do you mean by ensemble technique, explain the Random Forest algorithm.
2. What does random refer to in ‘Random Forest’?
3. How decision trees in Random Forest are different from decision trees in the Decision Tree algorithm?
4. What are overfitting and underfitting? Why does the decision tree algorithm suffer often from overfitting problems?
5. What is the difference between parameters and hyperparameters?
6. Name a few hyper-parameters of decision trees.
7. What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting?

**Questions:**

1. Find and deal with the null values in different columns.
2. Check the data types of each column and change them accordingly.
3. Find the 5-point summary of the numerical columns
4. Find the different unique values in each categorical column.
5. Create a correlation heatmap to check the correlation of different variables with each
other.
6. Do outlier analysis and remove the outliers from different columns.
7. Apply the scaling on numerical columns and encode the categorical ones.
8. Train the decision tree classification model with the help of all given columns.(Target variable : Stroke)
9. Create a decision tree diagram.
10. Calculate precision, recall, and other evaluation metrics.
