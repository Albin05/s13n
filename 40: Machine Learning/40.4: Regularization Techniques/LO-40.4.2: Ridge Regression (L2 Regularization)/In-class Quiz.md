## Question 1
What is the primary effect of **L2 Regularization** (Ridge) on the model coefficients (weights)?
A. It forces some coefficients to become exactly zero.
B. It increases the magnitude of the coefficients.
C. It shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but they rarely become exactly zero.
D. It randomly sets coefficients to 1 or -1.

## Question 2
Ridge Regression is particularly useful for solving problems caused by:
A. Missing data.
B. Multicollinearity (highly correlated features).
C. Underfitting.
D. Categorical variables.

## Question 3
In Scikit-Learn, the parameter that controls the strength of the Ridge penalty ($\lambda$) is named:
A. `lambda`
B. `penalty`
C. `alpha`
D. `gamma`
