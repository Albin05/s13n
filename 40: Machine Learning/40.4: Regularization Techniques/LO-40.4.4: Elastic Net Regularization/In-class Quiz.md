# In-Class Quiz

## Question 1
Elastic Net is a combination of which two regularization techniques?
A. Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.
B. Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1).
C. Forward Selection and Backward Elimination.
D. Gradient Descent and Normal Equation.

## Question 2
If you set the `l1_ratio` parameter to **0** in Scikit-Learn's `ElasticNet` model, which algorithm does it become equivalent to?
A. Lasso Regression.
B. Ridge Regression.
C. Standard Linear Regression (OLS).
D. Support Vector Machine.

## Question 3
Why might you choose Elastic Net over pure Lasso?
A. Because Lasso is too slow.
B. Because Lasso tends to pick only one feature from a group of correlated features, while Elastic Net can pick the whole group.
C. Because Elastic Net does not require hyperparameter tuning.
D. Because Elastic Net never sets coefficients to zero.
