# In-Class Quiz

## Question 1
What is the primary purpose of applying Regularization in Machine Learning?
A. To make the model train faster.
B. To reduce the training error to zero.
C. To prevent overfitting and improve generalization on unseen data.
D. To increase the number of features.

## Question 2
In the regularized cost function $Cost = \text{Error} + \lambda \times \text{Complexity}$, what happens if you set $\lambda$ (Lambda) to a very large number?
A. The model will overfit (High Variance).
B. The model will likely underfit (High Bias) because it forces weights to be near zero.
C. The model will find the perfect balance immediately.
D. The penalty term becomes zero.

## Question 3
Regularization typically discourages the model from learning:
A. The intercept/bias term.
B. Large weights (coefficients) for features.
C. The relationship between X and y.
D. Negative numbers.
