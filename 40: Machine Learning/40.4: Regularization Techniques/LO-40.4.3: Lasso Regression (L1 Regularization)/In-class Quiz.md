## Question 1
What is the most significant practical difference between **Lasso** and **Ridge** regression outputs?
A. Lasso produces larger coefficients than Ridge.
B. Lasso can set coefficients exactly to zero, performing feature selection.
C. Ridge can set coefficients exactly to zero.
D. Lasso works better for underfitting problems.

## Question 2
The penalty term in Lasso Regression corresponds to the:
A. L1 Norm (Sum of absolute values).
B. L2 Norm (Sum of squares).
C. L-Infinity Norm (Maximum value).
D. L0 Norm (Count of non-zero values).

## Question 3
If you have a dataset with **highly correlated features** (e.g., duplicate columns), how does Lasso usually handle them?
A. It keeps both features with equal weights.
B. It sets both feature weights to infinity.
C. It picks one feature randomly and sets the other's weight to zero.
D. It crashes.
