## **Q1. Analyze a product vision statement for clarity and alignment.**

### **Problem Description**

Learners are given a product vision statement and must evaluate whether it clearly communicates long-term goals, target users, and strategic focus.

### **Objective**

To assess the ability to **critically evaluate product vision statements** and identify areas for improvement.

### **Hint**

Check if the statement includes:

- Target audience
- Desired outcome or impact
- Strategic direction

### **Short Explanation**

A good product vision provides clarity, motivation, and direction for the team.

### **Detailed Explanation**

Example:

**Vision Statement:** “Our platform is the best place for users to manage tasks.”

**Analysis:**

- Lacks specificity of target users (“users” is vague)
- Outcome is subjective (“best place”)
- No strategic direction

**Improved Vision Statement:**

“Our platform empowers remote teams to coordinate tasks efficiently, improving productivity and reducing miscommunication.”

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- Avoid buzzwords without meaning
- Focus on user-centric and measurable outcomes

---

## **Q2. Prioritize features and initiatives in a roadmap based on business goals.**

### **Problem Description**

Learners are provided with multiple features and initiatives. They must sequence them on a roadmap considering business impact, dependencies, and feasibility.

### **Objective**

To evaluate the learner’s ability to **strategically plan and prioritize initiatives**.

### **Hint**

Consider:

- User impact
- Market timing
- Technical dependencies
- Strategic alignment

### **Short Explanation**

A roadmap communicates what will be built, when, and why, aligning the team and stakeholders.

### **Detailed Explanation**

Example features:

- Real-time collaboration
- Analytics dashboard
- Mobile app integration
- Chat support

**Prioritization:**

- Core hypothesis first: real-time collaboration
- High-impact but feasible: analytics dashboard
- Optional: mobile app integration and chat support

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- Dependencies between features must be respected
- Avoid overloading the roadmap with non-strategic items

---

## **Q3. Translate vision into a structured, time-bound roadmap.**

### **Problem Description**

Learners are given a vision statement and must create a high-level roadmap that sequences initiatives over time while highlighting milestones.

### **Objective**

To test the ability to **convert vision into actionable plans**.

### **Hint**

Use time horizons (short-term, mid-term, long-term) and indicate MVPs or strategic milestones.

### **Short Explanation**

Roadmaps are the bridge between vision and execution, showing stakeholders what will be delivered and when.

### **Detailed Explanation**

Example:

**Vision:** “Empower remote teams to coordinate tasks efficiently.”

**Roadmap:**

- **Q1:** MVP with task creation, assignment, and deadlines
- **Q2:** Analytics dashboard and reporting
- **Q3:** Mobile app release and chat integration

This sequence ensures early validation of core assumptions and structured delivery of additional value.

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- Roadmaps are high-level and flexible
- Avoid committing to exact dates for uncertain initiatives
