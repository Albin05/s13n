# PM - 1.2: Explain how problem-first thinking differs from solution-first thinking

---

# **Editorials.md**

## **Q1. Identify a scenario where a team is using solution-first thinking.**

### **Problem Description**

Teams often jump into building features before understanding the underlying need. This question helps learners differentiate between problem-first and solution-first behaviors.

### **Objective**

To evaluate if the learner can **recognize real-world patterns** of solution-first decision-making.

### **Hint**

Look for signs such as: predetermined features, skipping user research, or focusing on UI before defining the problem.

### **Short Explanation**

Solution-first thinking starts with “What should we build?” instead of “What problem are we solving?”

### **Detailed Explanation**

A team using solution-first thinking typically begins with assumptions. For example, if a team decides “We need a chatbot,” without validating whether users actually struggle with navigation or response times, they are committing to a solution prematurely.

Problem-first thinking avoids this by starting with evidence of pain points or unmet needs and only then exploring potential solutions.

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- Market pressure can force premature solution choices.
- Founders may push feature ideas based on intuition, not data.

## **Q2. Compare two approaches for defining a feature request using problem-first thinking.**

### **Problem Description**

This question asks learners to evaluate whether an approach properly uncovers user needs before proposing features.

### **Objective**

To assess the ability to **distinguish structured discovery from assumption-driven design**.

### **Hint**

Strong answers will highlight user needs, root causes, and context—not feature ideas.

### **Short Explanation**

Problem-first thinking frames a feature request through the lens of user motivations and obstacles.

### **Detailed Explanation**

A problem-first approach begins with:

- Who the user is
- What they are trying to achieve
- Why they are unable to achieve it
- The impact of the obstacle

Then the feature is derived.

For example, instead of “Build a dashboard,” a problem-first narrative would identify:

- Users need visibility into real-time inventory
- They currently use manual spreadsheets
- This causes delays and errors

Only after reviewing these insights would the dashboard become a proposed solution.

## **Q3. Analyze a flawed product pitch and point out where solution-first thinking took over.**

### **Problem Description**

Teams often justify features with buzzwords or trends. Learners must analyze and critique such logic.

### **Objective**

To test the ability to **deconstruct assumptions** and identify missing problem clarity.

### **Hint**

Look for: lack of user segment clarity, no data on pain points, or trendy solution ideas without cause.

### **Short Explanation**

Solution-first thinking manifests when decisions are based on desire to build, not user evidence.

### **Detailed Explanation**

A flawed pitch might say:

“Let’s build AI-based voice commands because AI is the future.”

This lacks:

- A defined target user
- A specific workflow where voice commands solve friction
- Evidence that users struggle with speed or accessibility

Analyzing such pitches helps PMs rebuild them into problem-first narratives.

# **Pre Read.md**

Problem-first thinking requires PMs to start with user needs, context, and underlying motivations before discussing what to build. This approach reduces rework, prevents misaligned feature development, and leads to solutions that users actually value.

It contrasts with solution-first thinking, where teams jump to ideas without defining the problem.

### **Examples**

- Problem-first: “Users take too long to onboard because instructions are unclear.”
- Solution-first: “We should redesign the entire onboarding UI.”

## **Topic 1: Why Product Managers Must Think Problem-First**

Problem-first thinking ensures that teams spend time understanding:

- who the user is
- what goal they’re trying to achieve
- what is blocking them
- why solving it matters

This anchors product decisions in real-world needs rather than assumptions.

**Talking Points**

- Most product failures stem from misunderstanding the problem, not poor execution.
- Good problem definition reduces experimentation cycles.

**Interactive Prompt**

Ask learners: “What happens when teams start with solutions?”

**Expected Duration:** 5 minutes

---

## **Topic 2: Indicators of Solution-First Thinking**

Common patterns include:

- Starting with features instead of needs
- Falling in love with ideas
- Lack of user context
- Trend-driven decisions (“Let's add AI because it’s cool”)

**Code/Structure Example**

A rewritten problem statement using a structured template:

```
User: New sellers on marketplace platforms
Goal: List products quickly
Obstacle: Listing form is too long
Impact: Sellers drop off during onboarding

```

**Expected Duration:** 10 minutes

---

## **Topic 3: Reframing Solution Requests into Problem Statements**

PMs often receive solution requests from stakeholders.

Example:

“Build a WhatsApp chatbot.”

Reframing questions include:

- What user does this help?
- What friction does it reduce?
- How does this improve user outcomes?
- What happens today without this solution?

**Activity**

Take a feature request and convert it into a problem-first narrative.

**Expected Duration:** 8 minutes

---

## **Topic 4: Case Study – A Feature that Failed Due to Solution-First Thinking**

Example scenario (fictional but realistic):

A team built a new homepage carousel to “improve engagement,” but no one assessed whether users struggled to find content.

Result: no engagement lift, increased load time, and development waste.

**Discuss:**

What problem should have been validated first?

**Expected Duration:** 7 minutes

# **Lecture Notes.md**

- Product thinking begins with clear definitions of user problems.
- Problem-first thinking focuses on user context and motivations rather than starting with ideas.
- Solution-first thinking occurs when teams build features without validated user needs.
- Strong PMs reframe feature requests into user problems.
- Problem statements must include:
    - user segment
    - goals
    - obstacles
    - impact
- Avoid trend-based prioritization (e.g., “add AI” without purpose).
- Use structured templates to articulate problems clearly.
- Mapping a solution request to a root problem reduces misalignment.
- Reviewing failed features helps identify flawed assumptions.
