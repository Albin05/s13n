# PM - 1.7 — Define MVPs and Value Propositions

# **Editorials.md**

## **Q1. Identify the minimum set of features for a given MVP scenario.**

### **Problem Description**

Learners are provided with a product idea and a target user segment. They must determine the minimum set of features needed to validate the core hypothesis.

### **Objective**

To assess the learner’s ability to **prioritize features** and distinguish essential functionality from nice-to-have elements.

### **Hint**

Focus on the problem the MVP intends to solve and the key user actions needed to validate the hypothesis. Avoid adding extra features.

### **Short Explanation**

An MVP includes only what is necessary to test the core value proposition with early users.

### **Detailed Explanation**

Example scenario:

**Product:** Task management app for remote teams

**Core problem:** Users struggle to coordinate tasks across distributed teams

**Possible features:** Task creation, task assignment, due dates, notifications, chat, analytics, integrations

**MVP selection:**

- Task creation
- Task assignment
- Due dates

These are essential for validating the hypothesis: Can distributed teams coordinate effectively using the app?

Optional features like chat or analytics can be added later.

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- MVP is not a prototype; it must be usable.
- Feature selection should maximize learning per development effort.

## **Q2. Evaluate a value proposition statement for clarity and focus.**

### **Problem Description**

Learners are provided with a product’s value proposition statement and must determine if it clearly communicates the user benefit, target audience, and differentiation.

### **Objective**

To evaluate the ability to **analyze and improve value propositions**.

### **Hint**

Check if the statement:

- Identifies the target user
- Specifies the problem being solved
- Shows the unique value of the solution

### **Short Explanation**

A clear value proposition communicates why users should care and what makes the product different from alternatives.

### **Detailed Explanation**

Example:

**Statement:** “Our app helps people manage tasks better.”

**Issues:**

- Vague “people” instead of a specific user segment
- “Manage tasks better” is subjective, not measurable
    
    **Improved statement:**
    
    “Our task management app helps remote teams coordinate tasks efficiently by providing simple assignment, tracking, and deadline management, reducing miscommunication and delays.”
    

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- Avoid buzzwords without meaning (“better,” “revolutionary”)
- Focus on tangible benefits and differentiators

---

## **Q3. Compare two MVP approaches and select the one that better validates the core hypothesis.**

### **Problem Description**

Learners are given two MVP designs for the same product idea and must choose which one provides the most actionable learning with minimal effort.

### **Objective**

To test the learner’s ability to **assess trade-offs and select high-impact MVPs**.

### **Hint**

Consider learning outcomes, feature necessity, and early user engagement.

### **Short Explanation**

The better MVP maximizes insights while minimizing development complexity.

### **Detailed Explanation**

Example:

**Product:** Fitness tracking app

**MVP A:** Step counting, calorie tracking, social feed, in-app purchases

**MVP B:** Step counting, calorie tracking

**Analysis:**

- MVP A includes extra features not needed to validate core hypothesis (do users track steps/calories?).
- MVP B focuses solely on the hypothesis, providing faster feedback and lower development risk.

**Selection:** MVP B

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- MVP must still be functional and deliver the core value.
- Avoid adding features just because they are “nice to have.”

# **Pre Read.md**

Defining MVPs and value propositions is a critical step in early product development. It ensures teams **focus on the core problem**, validate assumptions quickly, and communicate clearly to stakeholders and users.

**Key Concepts:**

- MVP = Minimum Viable Product
- Value Proposition = Clear articulation of target user, problem, and differentiator
- Trade-off between completeness and learning: do only what is essential

**Examples:**

- MVP: A photo-sharing app initially allows only uploading and sharing; filters and stories come later.
- Value Proposition: “Our app lets amateur photographers share their work with friends instantly, reducing friction compared to email sharing.”

**Helpful Resources:**

- Article: “How to Build an Effective MVP”
- Video: “Crafting Clear Value Propositions for Startups”

## **Topic 1: Understanding the MVP Concept**

Explain the purpose of MVPs: validate core assumptions, reduce development risk, and get early user feedback.

**Talking Points**

- MVP ≠ Prototype; it must be usable
- Focus on key features that test the hypothesis
- Avoid feature creep

**Expected Duration:** 5 minutes

---

## **Topic 2: Characteristics of a Good MVP**

- Solves core user problem
- Provides feedback to validate or invalidate assumptions
- Minimizes time and resource investment

**Activity:** Review sample MVPs and identify essential vs. optional features

**Expected Duration:** 8 minutes

---

## **Topic 3: Defining a Value Proposition**

- Identify target user, their pain point, and the unique benefit
- Ensure clarity, specificity, and measurable impact

**Interactive Prompt:** Evaluate a set of value propositions and suggest improvements

**Expected Duration:** 10 minutes

---

## **Topic 4: Balancing MVP Scope and Learning**

- Avoid building “complete products” too early
- Prioritize features that provide **maximum learning per development effort**
- Use frameworks like **RICE** (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) for prioritization

**Activity:** Compare two MVPs for the same product and discuss which yields better learning

**Expected Duration:** 7 minutes

---

# **Lecture Notes.md**

- MVP = smallest set of features to validate core assumptions
- Focus on solving **real user problems**, not implementing all ideas
- Value proposition = clear, concise statement of target user, problem, and differentiator
- Avoid buzzwords and vague language
- Use structured frameworks to prioritize features and opportunities
- Continuous iteration based on user feedback
