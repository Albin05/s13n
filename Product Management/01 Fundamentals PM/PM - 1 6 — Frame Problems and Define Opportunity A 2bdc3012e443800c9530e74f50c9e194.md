# PM - 1.6 — Frame Problems and Define Opportunity Areas

# **Editorials.md**

## **Q1. Given user research notes, identify a clear problem statement from multiple observed pain points.**

### **Problem Description**

Learners are provided with raw user research data containing several complaints, workarounds, and observations. They must synthesize these into a concise problem statement.

### **Objective**

To evaluate the ability to **distill key insights** into a structured, actionable problem statement.

### **Hint**

Focus on the most impactful user pain, target segment, and obstacle causing friction. Avoid jumping to solutions.

### **Short Explanation**

A problem statement should include:

- Who the user is
- What they are trying to achieve
- What prevents them from achieving it
- Why it matters

### **Detailed Explanation**

Example:

**Research notes:**

- Users spend 20+ minutes reconciling reports.
- Manual copying leads to errors.
- Users complain about slow system feedback.

**Problem statement:**

“**Financial analysts struggle to consolidate reports efficiently due to slow exports and manual processes, leading to frequent errors and wasted time.**”

Learners must identify the main obstacle (slow/manual exports) and link it to the user goal (efficient reporting) and impact (errors, wasted time).

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- Avoid framing solutions as part of the problem statement.
- Ensure clarity and brevity: one to two sentences is ideal.

---

## **Q2. Prioritize two opportunity areas derived from multiple problem statements.**

### **Problem Description**

Learners must analyze several problem statements and determine which areas provide the highest impact and feasibility.

### **Objective**

To assess learners’ ability to **evaluate opportunities** and justify prioritization.

### **Hint**

Consider:

- User impact
- Frequency/severity of the problem
- Implementation feasibility

### **Short Explanation**

Not all problems are equally important. Prioritize high-impact and actionable opportunities.

### **Detailed Explanation**

Example problem statements:

1. Users struggle to export reports.
2. Users find dashboard navigation confusing.
3. Users request more advanced filters.

**Opportunity prioritization:**

- **High impact:** Streamline report exports (directly improves workflow and reduces errors)
- **Medium impact:** Dashboard navigation improvements (may reduce friction but less urgent than report failures)

Justify choices using a simple impact vs. effort or value vs. complexity framework.

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- Avoid biasing prioritization based on personal preference.
- Validate assumptions with user data wherever possible.

---

## **Q3. Rewrite a vague problem statement into a structured problem statement using the user → goal → obstacle → impact template.**

### **Problem Description**

Learners are given a vague, high-level statement like “Users don’t like reports.” They must convert it into a clear, actionable problem statement.

### **Objective**

To test the ability to **clarify vague insights** into structured problem statements.

### **Hint**

Ask: Who? What goal? What prevents it? Why does it matter?

### **Short Explanation**

Structured problem statements prevent misalignment and ensure solutions target real pain.

### **Detailed Explanation**

Vague statement: “Users don’t like reports.”

**Structured rewrite:**

“**Financial analysts spend excessive time reconciling reports due to slow exports and lack of automation, resulting in errors and delayed decision-making.**”

Steps:

1. Identify the user segment (financial analysts)
2. Define the goal (efficient reporting)
3. Specify the obstacle (slow/manual processes)
4. Explain the impact (errors, delays)

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- Avoid inserting potential solutions.
- Problem statements should be concise but complete.

# **Pre Read.md**

Framing problems and defining opportunity areas ensures product teams focus on **real user pain points** and avoid building features for assumed needs.

Key Concepts:

- Difference between **problem statement** and **solution idea**
- Components of structured problem statements: user, goal, obstacle, impact
- Opportunity areas = high-impact, feasible areas derived from problem statements

**Examples:**

- Vague: “Users don’t like exporting.”
- Structured: “Financial analysts struggle to export reports efficiently due to slow system feedback, resulting in manual workarounds and errors.”

**Helpful Resources**

- Article: “How to Write Actionable Problem Statements”
- Video: “Opportunity Prioritization Frameworks”

**Illustration (description only)**

*Diagram mapping research notes → structured problem statements → prioritized opportunity areas.*

# **Lecture Script.md**

---

## **Topic 1: Why Problem Framing is Crucial**

Explain that poorly defined problems lead to wasted resources, misaligned solutions, and low adoption.

**Talking Points**

- Vague statements are misleading.
- Structured statements anchor discussions in real user pain.
- Opportunity areas help prioritize product efforts.

**Expected Duration:** 5 minutes

---

## **Topic 2: Anatomy of a Structured Problem Statement**

Cover the template: **User → Goal → Obstacle → Impact**

**Activity:** Break down 3 sample statements and identify each component.

**Expected Duration:** 8 minutes

---

## **Topic 3: From Problem Statements to Opportunity Areas**

- Use frameworks like **Impact vs. Effort** or **Value vs. Complexity**
- Prioritize opportunities that maximize user value and are feasible to implement

**Interactive Prompt:** Ask learners to rank 5 opportunity areas derived from research.

**Expected Duration:** 10 minutes

---

## **Topic 4: Rewriting Vague Statements**

- Demonstrate conversion of ambiguous notes into actionable problem statements
- Emphasize avoiding solution hints

**Activity:** Practice rewriting 3 vague statements.

**Expected Duration:** 9 minutes

---

# **Lecture Notes.md**

- Clear problem statements: user + goal + obstacle + impact
- Avoid embedding solutions
- Opportunity areas: prioritize based on value and feasibility
- Use structured frameworks for prioritization (Impact/Effort, Value/Complexity)
- Validated problem statements guide MVP and roadmap decisions
- Continuous iteration: revisit problem framing as more data emerges

*Table: Raw observation → structured problem statement → opportunity area → prioritization score.*
