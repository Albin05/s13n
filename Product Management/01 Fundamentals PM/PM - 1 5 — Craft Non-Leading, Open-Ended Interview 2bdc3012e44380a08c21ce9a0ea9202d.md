# PM - 1.5 — Craft Non-Leading, Open-Ended Interview Questions

# **Editorials.md**

---

## **Q1. Identify which of the following is a leading interview question.**

### **Problem Description**

Interviewers often unintentionally frame questions in a way that pushes users toward a specific answer. This question helps learners spot leading phrasing.

### **Objective**

To evaluate whether learners can **recognize biased and assumption-driven interview questions**.

### **Hint**

Look for hints of suggestion, assumptions, or value judgments in the question.

### **Short Explanation**

Leading questions subtly guide the user to agree with the interviewer’s hypothesis.

### **Detailed Explanation**

A question like:

**“How helpful was the new search feature?”**

already assumes the feature *is* helpful.

This restricts authentic responses and biases insights.

A non-leading alternative would be:

**“Tell me about your experience with the search feature.”**

It allows space for positive, negative, or neutral feedback — without direction.

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- Some users naturally give agreeable answers, making neutrality even more essential.
- Leading tone can exist even when words seem neutral.

---

## **Q2. Rewrite a leading question into a neutral, open-ended one.**

### **Problem Description**

This assesses a learner’s ability to correct biased phrasing and align with interview best practices.

### **Objective**

To check whether learners can **remove assumptions** and **open up the response space**.

### **Hint**

Break the question into:

- What is the assumption?
- How do we remove it?

### **Short Explanation**

A neutral question starts without implying the “right” answer.

### **Detailed Explanation**

Example leading question:

**“Why do you find the dashboard confusing?”**

This assumes:

1. The user finds it confusing
2. Confusion is the main emotion they feel

A neutral rewrite:

**“How do you usually navigate the dashboard?”**

or

**“Walk me through your experience with the dashboard.”**

These questions allow the user to express their actual perception.

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- Neutral phrasing must still remain specific enough to gather usable context.
- Avoid yes/no formulations.

---

## **Q3. Analyse a flawed interview script and identify where questions are leading.**

### **Problem Description**

Scripts often contain subtle interviewer biases. Learners must detect them.

### **Objective**

To evaluate the learner’s ability to **analyze and critique interview quality**.

### **Hint**

Check for:

- Hypothesis baked into the question
- Suggested emotions or behaviors
- Questions that start with “Do you think…” or “Wouldn’t it be better if…”

### **Short Explanation**

Leading questions bias responses and degrade research quality.

### **Detailed Explanation**

Example flawed script:

**“Wouldn’t it be easier if we added automation to this page?”**

This question:

- frames automation as obviously beneficial
- pressures the user to agree
- prevents discovery of alternative pain points

A better approach:

**“What part of this workflow takes the most time?”**

**“How do you currently handle it?”**

These invite honest insights without steering the user.

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- Even open-ended questions can become leading if asked with a confirming tone.
- Users may respond politely, masking true friction.

# **Pre Read.md**

Non-leading, open-ended questions ensure that user interviews uncover real motivations and behaviors rather than confirming preconceived ideas.

A good question does not imply an answer, suggest a preference, or assume a problem.

These questions typically begin with:

- *“How…”*
- *“Tell me about…”*
- *“Walk me through…”*
- *“What happened when…”*

### **Examples**

- Leading: “How frustrated are you with the onboarding flow?”
- Neutral: “Tell me about your experience during onboarding.”
- Leading: “Wouldn’t a bookmark feature help you?”
- Neutral: “How do you keep track of items you need later?”

## **Topic 1: Why Leading Questions Harm Discovery**

Leading questions push users toward confirming an existing assumption.

This reduces insight quality and creates false confidence.

**Talking Points**

- Users tend to agree with suggestions.
- Teams often build based on biased input, not real needs.
- Objective interviews depend entirely on question neutrality.

**Expected Duration:** 5 minutes

---

## **Topic 2: Characteristics of Non-Leading Questions**

A non-leading question:

- does not embed a hypothesis
- does not imply a positive or negative emotion
- allows a range of answers
- focuses on behaviors, not opinions

**Example Transformations**

```
Leading: "Do you find the reports too slow?"
Neutral: "Tell me about your experience with the reports."

Leading: "Wouldn't a search bar make things easier?"
Neutral: "How do you usually find what you're looking for?"

```

**Expected Duration:** 10 minutes

## **Topic 3: How to Rewrite Leading Questions**

Step-by-step approach:

1. Identify the assumption in the question.
2. Remove emotional or directional language.
3. Reframe toward behavior or context.
4. Open the question so multiple answers fit.

**Activity**

- Rewrite 4 sample leading questions together as a group.

**Expected Duration:** 8 minutes

## **Topic 4: Evaluating an Interview Script for Hidden Biases**

Common hidden biases:

- Suggestive words: “better,” “easier,” “helpful”
- Presumed emotions: “frustrated,” “annoyed,” “confused”
- Yes/no structures that limit nuance

**Discussion Prompt**

“What would happen if you used this script in a real interview?”

**Expected Duration:** 7 minutes

# **Lecture Notes.md**

- Leading questions bias user responses.
- Non-leading questions keep discovery open and authentic.
- Strong PMs avoid assumption-driven phrasing.
- Neutral questions focus on:
    - what the user does
    - how they do it
    - what challenges they face
    - what they expected
- Suggested answer formats reduce insight quality.
- Rewriting questions helps eliminate hidden assumptions.
- Interview scripts need continuous review for neutrality.
