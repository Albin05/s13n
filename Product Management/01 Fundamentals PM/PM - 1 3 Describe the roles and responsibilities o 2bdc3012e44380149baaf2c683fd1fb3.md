# PM - 1.3: Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Product Manager

# **Editorials.md**

## **Q1. Identify which activities fall under a Product Manager’s core responsibilities**

### **Problem Description**

PMs often work cross-functionally, and teams may confuse their responsibilities with those of designers, engineers, or project managers. This question helps learners distinguish PM-specific tasks.

### **Objective**

To ensure learners can **differentiate PM responsibilities from surrounding roles**.

### **Hint**

Focus on discovery, prioritization, strategy, and decision-making—not execution tasks or technical implementation.

### **Short Explanation**

PMs own *what* gets built and *why*, not *how* it gets built.

### **Detailed Explanation**

Core PM responsibilities include:

- Defining user problems
- Prioritizing features
- Creating product strategy and roadmap
- Aligning stakeholders
- Coordinating cross-functional teams
- Measuring outcomes
    
    They do not typically write production code, design high-fidelity visuals, or manage people.
    
    This separation of responsibilities allows the PM to remain objective and user-centric.
    

### **Constraints / Edge Cases**

- In early-stage startups, PMs may temporarily take on design, QA, or project management tasks.
- In large organizations, PM responsibilities may be more specialized (e.g., data PM, platform PM).

## **Q2. Compare the responsibilities of a Product Manager and a Product Designer in a discovery cycle.**

### **Problem Description**

Discovery often creates confusion about overlapping roles. This question tests whether learners understand collaboration boundaries.

### **Objective**

To evaluate the learner’s ability to **distinguish complementary responsibilities**.

### **Hint**

PM → business & user need alignment.

Designer → user experience, usability, workflow design.

### **Short Explanation**

PMs define the problem and success criteria; designers craft the experience to solve it.

### **Detailed Explanation**

During discovery:

- PMs identify business goals, validate problem statements, define success metrics, and evaluate feasibility constraints.
- Designers run usability studies, map user journeys, create wireframes, and propose UX flows.
    
    A healthy partnership ensures that **strategic decisions** (PM) and **experience design** (Designer) collaborate to produce a coherent solution.

## **Q3. Analyze a team scenario and identify which responsibility belongs to the PM.**

### **Problem Description**

Given a mixed set of tasks, learners need to isolate PM-specific responsibilities.

### **Objective**

To assess the learner's ability to **evaluate and categorize responsibilities**.

### **Hint**

Look for tasks related to prioritization, trade-offs, problem definition, and stakeholder alignment.

### **Short Explanation**

PM responsibilities revolve around decision-making, user understanding, and ensuring that solutions solve real problems.

### **Detailed Explanation**

Example scenario:

- Engineering team wants to speed up release cycles.
- Marketing wants more feature announcements.
- Users struggle with onboarding.

PM responsibility → deciding which problem delivers the highest value, validating it with data, and guiding the team toward solving it.

This requires stakeholder alignment and strategic prioritization—core PM functions.

# **Pre Read.md**

Product Managers sit at the intersection of user needs, business goals, and technical feasibility. Their core responsibility is to define the right problems, ensure clarity of goals, and guide the team toward outcomes—not outputs. PMs collaborate with engineering, design, marketing, data, and leadership to ensure that the product’s direction is strategic and grounded in real user needs.

### **Examples**

- A PM clarifies why onboarding completion has dropped by analyzing user behavior.
- A PM collaborates with design to refine a new feature’s workflow.
- A PM works with engineering to define feasibility trade-offs.

## **Topic 1: The Core Purpose of a Product Manager**

A Product Manager ensures that the team builds the right product—not just any product.

They begin with the user’s needs, validate the problem, align stakeholders, and define the desired outcome.

**Talking Points**

- PMs prioritize outcomes over output.
- PMs bridge gaps between business, design, and engineering.
- PMs make trade-off decisions that align with strategy.

**Example**

A PM translates an ambiguous goal (“increase user retention”) into a validated hypothesis with measurable metrics.

**Expected Duration:** 6 minutes

---

## **Topic 2: Key Responsibilities of a Product Manager**

Breakdown of responsibilities:

### **1. Problem Discovery**

- Identifying unmet needs
- Conducting user interviews
- Analyzing data

### **2. Product Strategy & Roadmapping**

- Setting long-term product direction
- Mapping features to business outcomes
- Prioritizing with frameworks (RICE, MoSCoW, etc.)

### **3. Cross-functional Collaboration**

- Aligning engineers, designers, marketers, and leadership
- Facilitating discussions
- Managing ambiguity

### **4. Execution Support**

- Writing clear requirements
- Running sprint ceremonies with the team
- Ensuring delivery aligns with intended outcomes

**Expected Duration:** 10 minutes

---

## **Topic 3: What PMs Do NOT Do**

To clarify boundaries:

PMs do **not**:

- write production code
- produce final designs
- act as project managers
- approve marketing campaigns
- manage team members
- micromanage engineering tasks

They instead **enable** teams by decision-making and removing ambiguity.

**Expected Duration:** 5 minutes

---

## **Topic 4: Role Comparison – PM vs. Designer vs. Engineer**

### **PM** → “What & Why”

### **Designer** → “How it feels / how users interact”

### **Engineer** → “How it works”

**Scenario Discussion**

For a new checkout flow:

- PM defines the problem: drop-offs at payment step.
- Designer maps the solution workflow.
- Engineer evaluates feasibility and estimates build effort.

**Expected Duration:** 8 minutes

---

## **Topic 5: Case Study – PM Responsibilities in a Real Feature Launch**

Example: Improving onboarding completion for a learning app.

PM responsibilities included:

- Validating that users struggled with account creation
- Prioritizing onboarding over other roadmap items
- Aligning design for shorter flows
- Working with engineering to simplify backend checks
- Defining success metrics (completion rate + activation)
- Reviewing post-launch performance

**Expected Duration:** 6 minutes

---

# **Lecture Notes.md**

- PMs focus on delivering user and business value by defining problems clearly.
- Core responsibilities include:
    - discovery and research
    - problem framing
    - defining roadmaps
    - writing requirements
    - stakeholder alignment
    - success measurement
- PMs collaborate deeply with engineering, design, marketing, data, and leadership.
- PMs prioritize trade-offs based on opportunity size and strategic alignment.
- PM roles differ from designers and engineers:
    - PM → defines what to build
    - Designer → defines how it looks and feels
    - Engineer → builds it and ensures technical feasibility
- PMs avoid owning tasks outside their lane (design, development, people management).
- Execution support includes refining user stories, clarifying scope, and ensuring outcomes are met.
- Effective PMs manage ambiguity and help teams stay aligned.
