### 1. Start with an Activity ( 5 minutes)

* Present a scenario: student overwrites old working code with a new feature; needs old version back.
* Ask: how to recover the older code?
* Discuss why manual file copying is not reliable.
* Present a second scenario: multiple developers editing the same file leading to overwrite issues.
* Highlight the need for a systematic solution.

### 2. Introduce Version Control ( 3 minutes)

* Define Version Control as a system that tracks file changes over time.
* Mention capabilities: restoring old versions, collaboration without overwriting, history tracking, backup safety.

### 3. Explain How Version Control Works ( 5 minutes)

* Show the concept of saved snapshots/versions.
* Describe ability to switch between versions and compare changes.

### 4. Give an Analogy and Small Demo ( 5 minutes)

* Use the example of multiple drafts of a written document.
* Open a Google Doc/Sheet, make a few changes, and show:

  * Version History
  * Who edited what
  * Restore previous versions option
* Connect the analogy to coding: need a similar but more powerful system that works offline and supports branching.

### 5. Explain Problems Solved by Version Control ( 3 minutes)

* List practical issues avoided: overwrite conflicts, accidental deletion, no history, no reasoning for changes, local-machine dependency.
* Reinforce suitability for professional development workflows.

### 6. Announce a Short Break (5 minutes)

* Allow learners to mentally absorb the concepts presented so far.

### 7. Types of Version Control Systems (5 minutes)

* Briefly introduce:

  * Local VCS
  * Centralized VCS
  * Distributed VCS
* Emphasize evolution toward distributed systems.

### 8. Most Widely Used VCS ( 3 minutes)
 
* State that Git is the current global standard due to flexibility, offline capability, and collaboration features.

### 9. What Will Be Used in the Module ( 3 minutes)

* Introduce Git for version control.
* Introduce GitHub as the cloud-based remote repository platform.
* Clarify the difference between Git (tool) and GitHub (service).

### 10. Conclude the topic with Reflection ( 2 minutes)

* Ask students to reflect briefly on:

  * How they currently track different file versions
  * How they would restore old code today
  * How they would collaborate safely on shared code
* Reinforce Version Control as the professional solution.
