Software development requires continuous updates and collaboration among multiple contributors. To prevent accidental overwrites, data loss, or confusion during teamwork, organizations use Source Code Management tools. These tools maintain a reliable record of changes and ensure smooth coordination within development teams.

## Tools Used in the Software Industry

Source code can be managed using different system architectures.

| Tool Name          | Nature of System  | Primary Usage Context                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SVN, Perforce      | Centralized       | Managed access through one shared server         |
| Mercurial, Git     | Distributed       | Full history stored on every developer’s machine |
| Azure DevOps / TFS | Centralized/Cloud | Repository plus project planning and automation  |

Distributed models like Git have become the preferred standard due to flexibility, performance, and reliability.

## Why Git Became the Standard

Git offers strong technical advantages:

- Development continues even without internet access
- Every contributor maintains a full version history
- Faster save and comparison operations
- Safe branching to explore new ideas without breaking the main code
- Secure change tracking and integrity
- Broad adoption in both open-source and enterprise projects
- Integrates with collaboration platforms used globally

These benefits support productivity for both small and large teams.

## What Git Provides

Git is installed on the developer’s machine and manages all versioning tasks locally.
It records every change, preserves historical versions, and organizes contributions while keeping a project’s structure stable over time.

## GitHub as a Cloud Collaboration Platform

GitHub hosts Git repositories online so teams can:

- Store work securely on remote servers
- Share contributions and provide feedback
- Track issues and improvements
- Show visible contribution history for professional credibility

| Aspect          | Git              | GitHub                            |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Location        | Local system     | Cloud platform                    |
| Internet needed | Not required     | Required                          |
| Main purpose    | Version tracking | Collaboration, backup, visibility |

Git operates independently. GitHub extends Git for teamwork and distribution.

## Getting Ready Before the Session

To participate in collaboration exercises smoothly:

- Create a GitHub account with a **professional name**
- Use an email that will later match your Git configuration
- Ensure your laptop supports installation of Git software

This alignment ensures proper authorship of contributions.
