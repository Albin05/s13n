# Q5. Define Version Control System (VCS).

## 1. Title

Definition of Version Control System

## 2. Problem Description

Students must clearly define what a Version Control System is and its purpose in software development.

## 3. Objective

To assess foundational understanding of version control terminology.

## 4. Hint

Think about tracking changes and restoring older versions.

## 5. Short Explanation

A VCS tracks changes in files and allows restoring previous versions when needed.

## 6. Detailed Explanation

A Version Control System is a tool that manages and records changes made to project files over time. It allows developers to:

- Maintain a complete history of modifications
- Compare different versions
- Revert to older versions in case of errors
- Track who made which changes
- Collaborate safely without overwriting each other's work

VCS ensures safety, accountability, and reliability in software development workflows.

## 7. Constraints / Edge Cases

None; basic conceptual clarity is expected.

# Q6. Explain why manually copying project folders is not a reliable version-management method.

## 1. Title

Limitations of Manual Folder Copying for Version Control

## 2. Problem Description

Students must explain the issues that arise when developers copy folders manually to manage versions.

## 3. Objective

To understand why structured version control is required instead of ad-hoc manual methods.

## 4. Hint

Think about confusion, errors, missing history, and collaboration issues.

## 5. Short Explanation

Manually copying folders causes confusion, lacks proper history, and increases the chance of errors and data loss.

## 6. Detailed Explanation

Manual folder copying is unreliable for several reasons:

- No systematic tracking of what changed
- Folder names become inconsistent (v1, v2, final-final, latest-final)
- Difficult to identify the correct or most recent version
- Easy to accidentally overwrite or delete important files
- No change history or ability to revert specific mistakes
- No mechanism for merging updates from multiple developers

Version Control Systems eliminate these problems by maintaining structured history, offering restore capabilities, and enabling safe collaboration.

## 7. Constraints / Edge Cases

Common real-world examples (such as naming confusion) are acceptable.

# Q7. Evaluate why Git has become the industry standard. Provide two strong reasons.

## 1. Title

Reasons for Git’s Industry-Wide Adoption

## 2. Problem Description

Students must evaluate and justify why Git is widely used compared to other version control tools.

## 3. Objective

To demonstrate understanding of Git’s advantages and industry relevance.

## 4. Hint

Think about speed, workflow flexibility, distributed nature, and branching.

## 5. Short Explanation

Git is fast, supports distributed workflows, and offers powerful branching and merging.

## 6. Detailed Explanation

Git became the industry standard for several key reasons:

### 1. Distributed Architecture

Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, enabling:

- Offline work
- Faster operations
- Reduced dependency on a central server
- Increased safety (no single point of failure)

### 2. Efficient and Powerful Branching

Git’s branching system is lightweight and easy to use. It supports:

- Isolated feature development
- Safe experimentation
- Parallel workflows
- Clean merging processes

Additional acceptable reasons include:

- Strong ecosystem (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Large community and support
- Excellent performance with large codebases

## 7. Constraints / Edge Cases

Students must provide two _well-explained_ reasons, not just list features.
