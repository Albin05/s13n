## 1. What is GitHub Project Management?

**GitHub** is commonly used to store and share code, but it also provides **built-in project management tools** that help teams plan and track work.

GitHub Project Management allows you to:

- Break a project into tasks
- Assign responsibility to team members
- Track progress of work
- Organize tasks by phases or deadlines

All of this happens **inside the same repository** where the code exists, making collaboration easier and more transparent.

The core tools used are:

- **Issues**
- **Labels**
- **Assignees**
- **Milestones**

---

## 2. Why Use GitHub for Project Management?

In real projects, development is not just about writing code. Teams must also:

- Decide what work needs to be done
- Decide who is responsible for each task
- Track what is completed and what is pending

If tasks are tracked separately (notes, chats, spreadsheets), they often become outdated or disconnected from the actual code.

GitHub solves this problem by keeping:

- Tasks
- Discussions
- Code changes

in **one single place**.

This is why GitHub is widely used for:

- Student projects
- Internships
- Open-source projects
- Small to medium teams

## 3. Merits and Demerits of GitHub Project Management

### Merits

- Tasks are directly linked to code
- Easy to learn and use
- No additional tools required
- Encourages professional development habits
- Excellent for collaboration

### Demerits

- No advanced sprint analytics
- No built-in burndown charts
- Requires discipline to update issues regularly

GitHub project management is **lightweight and developer-focused**, not a replacement for heavy enterprise tools.

## 4. Core Concepts Overview

| Feature   | Purpose                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Issue     | Represents a single task, bug, or feature |
| Label     | Categorizes and organizes issues          |
| Assignee  | Person responsible for the issue          |
| Milestone | A goal or phase grouping multiple issues  |

---

## 5. Issues — The Basic Unit of Work

An **Issue** represents one piece of work that needs to be done.

Examples:

- Build login page
- Fix validation bug
- Add pagination
- Improve UI responsiveness

Each issue includes:

- Title
- Description
- Comments (for discussion and updates)
- Status (open or closed)

---

### How to Create an Issue on GitHub (Step-by-Step)

1. Open your **GitHub repository**
2. Click the **Issues** tab at the top
3. Click **New Issue**
4. Fill in:

   - **Title** → short and clear summary
     (Example: `Create Login Page UI`)
   - **Description** → explain what needs to be done, expectations, or reference screenshots

5. Click **Submit new issue**

📌 Best practice:

- One issue = one task
- Avoid vague titles like _“Fix bugs”_

---

## 6. Labels — Organizing Issues

Labels help classify issues and make them easier to understand and filter.

Common label types:

- `bug`
- `feature`
- `enhancement`
- `frontend`
- `backend`
- `high-priority`

Labels answer the question:
**“What type of work is this?”**

---

### How to Create and Use Labels

**Creating a label:**

1. Go to **Issues → Labels**
2. Click **New label**
3. Enter:

   - Label name
   - Color
   - Short description

4. Save the label

**Assigning a label to an issue:**

1. Open an issue
2. On the right sidebar, click **Labels**
3. Select the required label(s)

📌 Labels help teams quickly filter issues as the project grows.

---

## 7. Assignees — Ownership and Responsibility

An **Assignee** is the person responsible for completing an issue.

Why assignees are important:

- Prevents confusion
- Avoids duplicate work
- Makes accountability clear

An issue without an assignee often remains incomplete.

---

### How to Assign an Issue

1. Open the issue
2. On the right sidebar, click **Assignees**
3. Select the person responsible

📌 Best practice:

- Assign **one main owner** per issue
- Multiple assignees only when truly needed

---

## 8. Milestones — Planning Work by Goals

A **Milestone** represents a goal, phase, or deadline in a project.

Examples:

- Sprint 1
- MVP Release
- Version 1.0
- Backend Completion

Milestones group related issues and show overall progress automatically.

---

### How to Create a Milestone

1. Go to **Issues → Milestones**
2. Click **New Milestone**
3. Enter:

   - Title (e.g., `Sprint 1`)
   - Description (optional)
   - Due date (optional)

4. Click **Create milestone**

---

### Assigning Issues to a Milestone

1. Open an issue
2. On the right sidebar, select a **Milestone**
3. Save changes

GitHub automatically updates:

- Number of open issues
- Number of closed issues
- Completion percentage

---

## 9. Tracking Project Progress

Once issues are:

- Created
- Labeled
- Assigned
- Added to milestones

Progress tracking becomes automatic.

When an issue is closed:

- Milestone progress updates
- Team can clearly see what is done and what remains

This removes the need for separate progress reports.

---

## 10. Recommended Workflow for Student Projects

1. Break project into small issues
2. Add meaningful labels
3. Assign each issue to a team member
4. Group issues under milestones
5. Close issues only after work is completed

This workflow mirrors **real industry practices** and prepares students for professional environments.
