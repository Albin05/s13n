Git manages code locally, but collaboration requires a shared remote repository. Remotes enable teams to synchronize work, review changes, and control what becomes part of the project.

---

## **1. Git vs GitHub**

- Git handles local version control
- GitHub hosts repositories and enables collaboration
- Git manages code; GitHub manages teamwork

---

## **2. Remote Repository**

A remote repository is a Git repository stored outside the local machine.

- Acts as a shared source of truth
- Stores full project history
- Enables collaboration and backup

---

## **3. Local and Remote Relationship**

- Work happens locally first
- Changes are shared explicitly
- Remote updates are pulled intentionally

---

## **4. Meaning of `origin`**

- Default name for the primary remote
- Shortcut reference, not a keyword
- A repository can have multiple remotes

---

## **5. Repository Basics**

A repository contains code, history, and branches.

- Local repositories exist on machines
- Remote repositories exist on GitHub

---

## **6. Cloning**

- Creates a local copy of a remote repository
- Includes complete commit history
- Automatically links to the remote

---

## **7. Push and Pull**

- Push sends local changes to remote
- Pull brings remote changes locally
- Synchronization is always manual

---

## **8. Collaboration Models**

- **Collaborators**: direct access to the same remote
- **Forking**: independent copy when access is restricted

---

## **9. Pull Requests**

- Propose changes to a remote repository
- Enable review and discussion
- Control what gets merged

---

## **10. Review Decisions**

- Approve allows merging
- Request changes blocks merging

---

## **11. Typical Collaboration Flow**

1. Remote repository exists
2. Work is done locally
3. Changes are pushed
4. Pull Request is opened
5. Review and merge
6. Local copies sync again
