## 1. **Set Context (3 minutes)**

- “Open **GitHub** in the browser.”
- “Open an existing repository or say we are using a demo repo called
  **`First-Git-Project`**.”
- “Today we are **not writing code** — we are learning how to **manage project work**.”
- “In real projects, code is only one part. Planning, tracking, and ownership are equally important.”

**Say clearly:**

> “GitHub is not just a code storage platform.
> It is also a **lightweight project management tool**, and industry uses it heavily.”

---

## 2. **Introduce GitHub Project Management (4 minutes)**

**Explain verbally (no clicking yet):**

- “GitHub Project Management means:

  - Breaking work into tasks
  - Assigning responsibility
  - Tracking progress
  - Grouping work by goals”

**Highlight the key idea:**

> “Everything happens **inside the repository** — tasks, discussions, and code stay connected.”

---

### Core Tools (Show but don’t click deeply yet)

- Issues
- Labels
- Assignees
- Milestones

**Say:**

> “If you understand these four, you can manage **any student or small professional project**.”

---

## 3. **Demonstrate Issues — Creating the First Task (6 minutes)**

### **Step 1 — Open Issues Tab**

- Click **Issues** tab in the repository.

**Say:**

> “An issue represents **one unit of work**.
> One task. One responsibility.”

---

### **Step 2 — Create a New Issue**

- Click **New Issue**

**Type live:**

- **Title:** `Create Login Page UI`

- **Description:**

  ```
  Build a responsive login page
  - Email and password fields
  - Login button
  - Basic validation
  ```

- Click **Submit new issue**

---

**Explain what students should observe:**

- Issue number created
- Status is **Open**
- Comment section available

**Say clearly:**

> “One issue must represent **one clear task**.
> Never mix multiple tasks in one issue.”

---

## 4. **Labels — Organizing Work (4 minutes)**

### **Step 1 — Show Labels Section**

- Go to **Issues → Labels**

**Explain:**

> “Labels answer one question:
> **What kind of work is this?**”

---

### **Step 2 — Create a Label**

- Click **New label**
- Name: `frontend`
- Choose a color
- Description: `UI related work`
- Save

---

### **Step 3 — Assign Label to Issue**

- Open the previously created issue
- Click **Labels** (right sidebar)
- Select `frontend`

**Explain while doing:**

> “As projects grow, labels help us **filter and prioritize** quickly.”

---

## 5. **Assignees — Ownership & Accountability (4 minutes)**

### **Step 1 — Assign an Owner**

- In the same issue
- Click **Assignees**
- Select a team member (or yourself)

**Say clearly:**

> “An unassigned issue is usually an **unfinished issue**.”

---

**Best practice explanation:**

- One issue → one main owner
- Discussion can involve many, ownership should be clear

---

## 6. **Milestones — Planning by Goals (6 minutes)**

### **Step 1 — Create a Milestone**

- Go to **Issues → Milestones**
- Click **New Milestone**

**Fill:**

- Title: `Sprint 1`

- Description: `Basic UI and authentication setup`

- (Optional) Due date

- Click **Create milestone**

---

### **Step 2 — Assign Issue to Milestone**

- Open the issue again
- Select **Sprint 1** under Milestone

---

**Explain what GitHub does automatically:**

- Counts total issues
- Tracks open vs closed
- Shows completion percentage

**Say:**

> “This is automatic progress tracking —
> no Excel sheets, no manual reports.”

---

## 7. **Tracking Progress Live (4 minutes)**

### **Step 1 — Close an Issue**

- Scroll down
- Click **Close issue**

---

### **Step 2 — Show Milestone Progress**

- Go back to **Milestones**

## 8. **Recommended Workflow — Explain While Pointing (4 minutes)**

Walk through the flow verbally:

1. Break work into small issues
2. Add proper labels
3. Assign ownership
4. Group using milestones
5. Close issues only after completion

**Industry mapping:**

> “This is the same workflow used in:
>
> - Internships
> - Open-source projects
> - Real development teams”

---

## 9. **Student Hands-on Practice (5 minutes)**

Ask students to perform:

1. Create **one issue**
2. Add **one label**
3. Assign **one owner**
4. Add issue to **Sprint 1 milestone**

Walk around / observe screens.
