## Problem 26: Break on Condition Sum

**Problem:** Add numbers from 1 to N, but stop when sum exceeds 100.

**Solution:**
```python
total = 0
num = 0

for i in range(1, 100):
    total += i
    if total > 100:
        num = i
        break

print(f"Sum exceeded 100 at number: {num}")
print(f"Total sum: {total}")
```

**Output:**
```
Sum exceeded 100 at number: 14
Total sum: 105
```

**Explanation:**
- Start with total = 0
- Add each number: 1, 2, 3, ...
- After adding 13: total = 91
- After adding 14: total = 105 (exceeds 100)
- Store the number that caused excess (14) and break
- Sum of 1+2+3+...+14 = 105

**Key Concept:** Break with accumulation helps find threshold crossings.
