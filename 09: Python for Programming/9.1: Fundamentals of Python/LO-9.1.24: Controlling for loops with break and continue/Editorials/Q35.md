## Problem 35: Nested Break with Flag

**Problem:** Search for a target value in a 2D list. Print "Found" or "Not found".

**Solution:**
```python
matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
target = 4
found = False

for row_idx, row in enumerate(matrix):
    print(f"Searching row {row_idx}...")
    for col_idx, value in enumerate(row):
        if value == target:
            print(f"Found at row {row_idx}, col {col_idx}!")
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        break

if not found:
    print("Not found in matrix")
```

**Output:**
```
Searching row 0...
Searching row 1...
Found at row 1, col 1!
```

**Explanation:**
- Use flag variable to track if target found
- Search each row with message
- Inner loop searches within row
- When found, set flag and break inner loop
- Check flag after inner loop to break outer loop
- Row 0: [1, 2] - not found
- Row 1: [3, 4] - found 4 at position 1
- Set flag, break inner, check flag, break outer

**Key Concept:** Flag variables enable breaking out of nested loops cleanly.

## Summary of Key Concepts

### Break Statement
1. **Exits loop immediately** when condition met
2. **Useful for searches** - stop when found
3. **Works with for-else** - else skipped if break occurs
4. **Only affects innermost loop** in nested structures
5. **Can be combined with counters** to limit iterations

### Continue Statement
1. **Skips current iteration** and moves to next
2. **Perfect for filtering** unwanted values
3. **Can have multiple continues** in one loop
4. **Only affects innermost loop** in nested structures
5. **Reduces nesting** by handling special cases early

### For-Else Clause
1. **Executes if loop completes** without break
2. **Detects search failure** elegantly
3. **Validates "all" conditions** cleanly
4. **Doesn't execute** if break occurs
5. **Works with both break and continue**

### Best Practices
1. **Check break before continue** when combining
2. **Use flags** for nested loop breaking
3. **Keep conditions clear** and well-commented
4. **Prefer for-else** over flag variables when possible
5. **Consider alternatives** - sometimes restructuring is better

### Common Patterns
1. **Search**: Loop until found, break
2. **Filter**: Continue on unwanted, process rest
3. **Limit**: Count and break at threshold
4. **Validate**: Break on invalid, else for success
5. **Early exit**: Break on special condition
