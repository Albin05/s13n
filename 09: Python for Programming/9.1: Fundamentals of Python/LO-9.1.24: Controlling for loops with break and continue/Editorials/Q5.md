## Problem 5: First Vowel

**Problem:** Find the first vowel in a string and print its position.

**Solution:**
```python
text = "Python"
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"

for index, char in enumerate(text):
    if char in vowels:
        print(f"First vowel: {char} at position {index}")
        break
```

**Output:**
```
First vowel: o at position 4
```

**Explanation:**
- Use `enumerate()` to get both index and character
- Check if character is in vowels string
- When found, print the vowel and its position, then break
- Position 4 means it's the 5th character (0-indexed)

**Key Concept:** Enumerate provides index-value pairs, useful for position-based searches.
