## Problem 2: Skip Odd Numbers

**Problem:** Print only even numbers from 1 to 10 using continue to skip odd numbers.

**Solution:**
```python
for num in range(1, 11):
    if num % 2 != 0:
        continue
    print(num)
```

**Output:**
```
2
4
6
8
10
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop through numbers 1 to 10
- If number is odd (`num % 2 != 0`), use `continue` to skip to next iteration
- Continue skips the print statement for odd numbers
- Only even numbers reach the print statement

**Alternative Solution:**
```python
for num in range(1, 11):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num)
```

**Key Concept:** Continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next one, useful for filtering.
