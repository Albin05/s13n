## Problem 28: Nested Continue

**Problem:** Print a multiplication table for 1-5, but skip results that are multiples of 5.

**Solution:**
```python
for i in range(1, 5):
    for j in range(1, 5):
        result = i * j
        if result % 5 == 0:
            continue
        print(f"{i}x{j}={result:2}", end="  ")
    print()  # New line after each row
```

**Output:**
```
1x1=1  1x2=2  1x3=3  1x4=4
2x1=2  2x2=4  2x3=6  2x4=8
3x1=3  3x2=6  3x3=9  3x4=12
4x1=4  4x2=8  4x3=12 4x4=16
```

**Explanation:**
- Nested loops for i and j from 1 to 4
- Calculate product
- If product divisible by 5, continue skips printing
- Skipped results: 5 (1×5, but 5 not in range), 10 (2×5), 15 (3×5), 20 (4×5)
- Since j only goes to 4, no multiples of 5 in this range actually
- Table prints completely

**Corrected Solution (Range 1-6):**
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        result = i * j
        if result % 5 == 0:
            continue
        print(f"{i}x{j}={result:2}", end="  ")
    print()
```
This would skip 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.

**Key Concept:** Continue in nested loops only affects the innermost loop.
