## Problem 22: Skip Vowels in String

**Problem:** Print each character in a string except vowels.

**Solution:**
```python
text = "Education"

for char in text:
    if char.lower() in "aeiou":
        continue
    print(char, end=' ')
```

**Output:**
```
E d c t n
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop through each character
- Convert to lowercase for comparison
- Check if it's a vowel (a, e, i, o, u)
- If vowel, continue skips it
- 'E' is capital but we check lowercase 'e' (vowel) - wait, this would skip it!

**Corrected Solution:**
```python
text = "Education"

for char in text:
    if char.lower() in "aeiou":
        continue
    print(char, end=' ')
```

**Actual Output:**
```
d c t n
```

**Explanation (Corrected):**
- 'E' → 'e' is vowel, skip
- 'd' is consonant, print
- 'u' is vowel, skip
- 'c' is consonant, print
- 'a' is vowel, skip
- 't' is consonant, print
- 'i' is vowel, skip
- 'o' is vowel, skip
- 'n' is consonant, print

**Key Concept:** Use `.lower()` to make case-insensitive comparisons.
