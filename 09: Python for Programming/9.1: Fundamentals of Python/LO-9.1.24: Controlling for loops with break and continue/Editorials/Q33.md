## Problem 33: Early Exit Search

**Problem:** Search for "exit" command in a list. Stop processing when found.

**Solution:**
```python
commands = ["start", "run", "exit", "stop", "end"]

for cmd in commands:
    if cmd == "exit":
        print("Exit command found!")
        break
    print(f"Processing: {cmd}")
```

**Output:**
```
Processing: start
Processing: run
Exit command found!
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop through commands
- Check for "exit" first
- If found, print message and break
- Otherwise, process the command
- "stop" and "end" never processed

**Key Concept:** Checking break condition before processing saves unnecessary work.
