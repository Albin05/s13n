## Problem 23: First N Evens

**Problem:** Print the first 5 even numbers from a range of 1 to 50.

**Solution:**
```python
count = 0

for num in range(1, 51):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num, end=' ')
        count += 1
        if count == 5:
            break
```

**Output:**
```
2 4 6 8 10
```

**Explanation:**
- Initialize counter to track how many evens printed
- Loop through 1 to 50
- Check if number is even
- If even, print it and increment counter
- When counter reaches 5, break
- Only first 5 evens are printed: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

**Key Concept:** Counters with break can limit output to first N matches.
