## Problem 6: Sum Until Negative

**Problem:** Calculate sum of numbers until you encounter a negative number.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [5, 10, 15, -3, 20, 25]
total = 0

for num in numbers:
    if num < 0:
        break
    total += num

print(f"Sum: {total}")
```

**Output:**
```
Sum: 30
```

**Explanation:**
- Initialize total to 0
- Loop through numbers, adding each to total
- When we encounter -3 (first negative), break immediately
- Total = 5 + 10 + 15 = 30
- Numbers after -3 are never processed

**Key Concept:** Break can stop processing based on a condition, even mid-collection.
