## Problem 3: Search for Name

**Problem:** Search for "Alice" in a list of names and print "Found!" when you find it.

**Solution:**
```python
names = ["Bob", "Charlie", "Alice", "David"]

for name in names:
    print(f"Checking {name}")
    if name == "Alice":
        print("Found!")
        break
```

**Output:**
```
Checking Bob
Checking Charlie
Checking Alice
Found!
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop through each name in the list
- Print "Checking" message for each name
- When we find "Alice", print "Found!" and break
- David is never checked because break exits the loop

**Key Concept:** Break is useful for early exit when you've found what you're looking for.
