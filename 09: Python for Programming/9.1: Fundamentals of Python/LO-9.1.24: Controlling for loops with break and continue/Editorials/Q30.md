## Problem 30: Combined Break and Continue

**Problem:** Print numbers 1 to 30 with these rules:
- Skip multiples of 3
- Stop when you reach a multiple of 17

**Solution:**
```python
for num in range(1, 31):
    if num % 17 == 0:
        break
    if num % 3 == 0:
        continue
    print(num, end=' ')
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 4 5 7 8 10 11 13 14 16
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop 1 to 30
- Check break condition first: if divisible by 17, stop
- Then check continue condition: if divisible by 3, skip
- Print: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16
- Skip: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 (multiples of 3)
- Stop at: 17 (first multiple of 17)
- Order matters: break before continue

**Key Concept:** When combining break and continue, order of checks matters.
