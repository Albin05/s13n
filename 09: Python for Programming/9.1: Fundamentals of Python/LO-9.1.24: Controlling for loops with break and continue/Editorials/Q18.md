## Problem 18: Interactive Search

**Problem:** Search for multiple targets in a list. Stop if any target is not found.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
targets = [20, 50, 60]

for target in targets:
    for index, num in enumerate(numbers):
        if num == target:
            print(f"{target} found at index {index}")
            break
    else:
        print(f"{target} not found - stopping search")
        break
```

**Output:**
```
20 found at index 1
50 found at index 4
60 not found - stopping search
```

**Explanation:**
- Outer loop iterates through targets
- Inner loop searches for each target in numbers
- If target found, break inner loop (else doesn't execute)
- If inner loop completes without break, target not found
- The else clause of inner loop breaks outer loop
- 20 found at index 1, 50 found at index 4
- 60 not in list, inner loop completes, else breaks outer loop

**Key Concept:** For-else can control outer loops from inner loop completion.
