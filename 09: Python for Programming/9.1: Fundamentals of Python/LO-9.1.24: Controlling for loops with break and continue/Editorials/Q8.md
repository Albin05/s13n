## Problem 8: Find Target in Range

**Problem:** Search for the number 7 in range 1 to 10. Print all numbers until you find 7.

**Solution:**
```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i, end=' ')
    if i == 7:
        print("\nFound target!")
        break
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Found target!
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop through range 1 to 10
- Print each number
- When we reach 7, print success message and break
- Numbers 8, 9, 10 are never processed

**Key Concept:** You can perform actions before breaking from a loop.
