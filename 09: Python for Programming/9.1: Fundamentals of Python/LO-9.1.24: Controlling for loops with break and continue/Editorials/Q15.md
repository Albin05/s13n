## Problem 15: Nested Loop Break

**Problem:** Find a number in a 2D list and print its position (row, col).

**Solution:**
```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
target = 5
found = False

for row_idx, row in enumerate(matrix):
    for col_idx, num in enumerate(row):
        if num == target:
            print(f"Found {target} at row {row_idx}, col {col_idx}")
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        break
```

**Output:**
```
Found 5 at row 1, col 1
```

**Explanation:**
- Use nested loops with enumerate to track positions
- Inner loop checks each element in a row
- When target found, set flag and break inner loop
- After inner loop, check flag and break outer loop if needed
- Without flag, only inner loop would break, outer would continue
- Position (1, 1) means second row, second column (0-indexed)

**Key Concept:** Breaking nested loops requires a flag variable or function return.
