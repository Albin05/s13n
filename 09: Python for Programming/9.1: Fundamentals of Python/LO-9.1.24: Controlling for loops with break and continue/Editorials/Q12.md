## Problem 12: Loop with Else

**Problem:** Search for a number greater than 10. Use for-else to handle "not found" case.

**Solution:**
```python
# List 1
numbers1 = [2, 4, 6, 8]
print("List 1:")
for num in numbers1:
    if num > 10:
        print(f"Found large number: {num}")
        break
else:
    print("No large number found")

print()

# List 2
numbers2 = [2, 4, 15, 8]
print("List 2:")
for num in numbers2:
    if num > 10:
        print(f"Found large number: {num}")
        break
else:
    print("No large number found")
```

**Output:**
```
List 1:
No large number found

List 2:
Found large number: 15
```

**Explanation:**
- The `else` clause of a for loop executes ONLY if the loop completes without encountering a break
- List 1: No number > 10, so loop completes naturally and else executes
- List 2: 15 > 10, so we break, and else does NOT execute
- This is a clean way to handle "search not found" scenarios

**Key Concept:** For-else provides elegant handling of search success/failure.
