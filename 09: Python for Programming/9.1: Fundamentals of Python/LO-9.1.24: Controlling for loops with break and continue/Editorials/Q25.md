## Problem 25: Skip Empty Strings

**Problem:** Print non-empty strings from a list.

**Solution:**
```python
words = ["Hello", "", "World", "", "Python"]

for word in words:
    if not word:  # or: if word == ""
        continue
    print(word)
```

**Output:**
```
Hello
World
Python
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop through each word
- Empty string is "falsy" in Python, so `not word` is True
- If word is empty, continue skips it
- Only non-empty strings are printed

**Key Concept:** Empty strings are falsy, making `not word` a concise check.
