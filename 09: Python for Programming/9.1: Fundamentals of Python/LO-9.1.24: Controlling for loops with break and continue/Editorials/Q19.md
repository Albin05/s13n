## Problem 19: Skip Range

**Problem:** Print numbers from 1 to 20, but skip numbers 8 through 12 (inclusive).

**Solution:**
```python
for num in range(1, 21):
    if 8 <= num <= 12:
        continue
    print(num, end=' ')
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop through 1 to 20
- Check if number is in range 8-12 using chained comparison
- If yes, continue skips it
- Numbers 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 are all skipped
- All others are printed

**Key Concept:** Chained comparisons (`8 <= num <= 12`) are concise and readable.
