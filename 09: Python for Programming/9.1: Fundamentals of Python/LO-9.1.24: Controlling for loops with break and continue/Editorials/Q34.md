## Problem 34: Range with Both

**Problem:** Print squares of numbers 1 to 20, but skip perfect cubes and stop when square > 200.

**Solution:**
```python
for num in range(1, 21):
    square = num ** 2

    # Check if square exceeds 200
    if square > 200:
        print(f"Stopped at {num} (square = {square})")
        break

    # Check if num is a perfect cube
    cube_root = round(num ** (1/3))
    if cube_root ** 3 == num:
        continue

    print(square, end=' ')
```

**Output:**
```
4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 121 144 169 196
Stopped at 15 (square = 225)
```

**Explanation:**
- For each number, calculate its square
- If square > 200, print stop message and break
- Check if number is perfect cube (1, 8, 27...)
- 1 is perfect cube (1³=1), skip
- 8 is perfect cube (2³=8), skip
- Other numbers printed as squares
- At 15: 15² = 225 > 200, so stop

**Key Concept:** Complex conditions can combine break and continue with calculations.
