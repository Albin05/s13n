## Problem 27: Continue Pattern

**Problem:** Print numbers 1 to 15, but skip numbers divisible by 2 OR 3.

**Solution:**
```python
for num in range(1, 16):
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        continue
    print(num, end=' ')
```

**Output:**
```
1 5 7 11 13
```

**Explanation:**
- Check if divisible by 2 OR by 3
- Skip: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15
- Print: 1 (neither), 5 (neither), 7 (neither), 11 (neither), 13 (neither)
- These are numbers coprime to both 2 and 3

**Key Concept:** Logical OR in continue conditions combines multiple filter criteria.
