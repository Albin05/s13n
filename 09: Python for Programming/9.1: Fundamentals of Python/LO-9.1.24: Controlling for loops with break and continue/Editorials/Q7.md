## Problem 7: Skip Multiples of 3

**Problem:** Print numbers 1 to 20, but skip multiples of 3.

**Solution:**
```python
for num in range(1, 21):
    if num % 3 == 0:
        continue
    print(num, end=' ')
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 4 5 7 8 10 11 13 14 16 17 19 20
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop through 1 to 20
- Check if number is divisible by 3 (`num % 3 == 0`)
- If yes, continue skips the print statement
- Multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18) are skipped
- All other numbers are printed

**Key Concept:** Continue can filter based on mathematical conditions.
