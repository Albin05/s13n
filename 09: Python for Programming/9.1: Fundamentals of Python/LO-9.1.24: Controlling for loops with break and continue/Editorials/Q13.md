## Problem 13: Count Until Condition

**Problem:** Count how many numbers you can process before encountering a number divisible by 7.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18]
count = 0

for num in numbers:
    if num % 7 == 0:
        break
    count += 1

print(f"Processed {count} numbers before stopping")
```

**Output:**
```
Processed 5 numbers before stopping
```

**Explanation:**
- Initialize counter to 0
- For each number, check if divisible by 7
- If yes (14), break immediately
- If no, increment counter
- We process 1, 3, 5, 9, 11 (5 numbers) before hitting 14
- Counter gives us the count before break

**Key Concept:** Counters can track how many iterations occurred before break.
