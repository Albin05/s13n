## Problem 14: Skip Short Words

**Problem:** Print words with 5 or more letters, skip shorter words.

**Solution:**
```python
words = ["Hi", "Python", "is", "amazing", "for", "coding"]

for word in words:
    if len(word) < 5:
        continue
    print(word)
```

**Output:**
```
Python
amazing
coding
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop through each word
- Check word length
- If less than 5 characters, continue skips it
- "Hi" (2), "is" (2), "for" (3) are skipped
- "Python" (6), "amazing" (7), "coding" (6) are printed

**Key Concept:** Continue can filter based on string properties like length.
