## Problem 9: Password Validator

**Problem:** Check if a password has at least 8 characters. Stop checking after finding the first valid password.

**Solution:**
```python
passwords = ["abc", "pass123", "SecurePassword", "123"]

for password in passwords:
    print(f"Checking: {password}")
    if len(password) >= 8:
        print("Valid password found!")
        break
```

**Output:**
```
Checking: abc
Checking: pass123
Checking: SecurePassword
Valid password found!
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop through each password
- Print which password we're checking
- Check if length is at least 8 characters
- "SecurePassword" has 14 characters, so it's valid
- Break immediately, "123" is never checked

**Key Concept:** Break saves processing time by stopping once requirement is met.
