## Problem 10: Skip Spaces

**Problem:** Print each character in a string except spaces.

**Solution:**
```python
text = "Hello World"

for char in text:
    if char == " ":
        continue
    print(char, end=' ')
```

**Output:**
```
H e l l o W o r l d
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop through each character in the string
- If character is a space, continue skips it
- All other characters are printed
- Space between "Hello" and "World" is skipped

**Key Concept:** Continue is useful for filtering specific characters from strings.
