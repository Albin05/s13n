## Problem 24: Dictionary Search

**Problem:** Search for a key in a dictionary. If found, print its value and stop.

**Solution:**
```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "NYC"}
search_key = "age"

for key, value in person.items():
    if key == search_key:
        print(f"Found {key}: {value}")
        break
```

**Output:**
```
Found age: 25
```

**Explanation:**
- Use `.items()` to loop through key-value pairs
- Check if current key matches search key
- When found, print key and value, then break
- More efficient than checking all keys

**Alternative (Direct Access):**
```python
if "age" in person:
    print(f"Found age: {person['age']}")
```
This is actually more efficient for dictionaries, but the loop demonstrates break usage.

**Key Concept:** Break works with dictionary iteration, though direct access is often better.
