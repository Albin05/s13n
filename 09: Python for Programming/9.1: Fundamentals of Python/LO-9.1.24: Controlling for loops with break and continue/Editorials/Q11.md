## Problem 11: First Duplicate

**Problem:** Find the first number that appears more than once in a list.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5]
seen = set()

for num in numbers:
    if num in seen:
        print(f"First duplicate: {num}")
        break
    seen.add(num)
```

**Output:**
```
First duplicate: 2
```

**Explanation:**
- Use a set to track numbers we've seen
- For each number, check if it's already in the set
- If yes, it's a duplicate - print and break
- If no, add it to the set and continue
- First occurrence of 2 is added to set, second occurrence triggers duplicate detection

**Key Concept:** Sets provide O(1) lookup for efficient duplicate detection.
