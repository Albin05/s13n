## Problem 1: Find First Even

**Problem:** Write a program that finds and prints the first even number from a list, then stops.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11]

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"Found: {num}")
        break
```

**Output:**
```
Found: 8
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop through each number in the list
- Check if the number is even using `num % 2 == 0`
- When we find the first even number (8), print it and use `break` to exit the loop
- Break immediately stops the loop execution, so we don't check 9 or 11

**Key Concept:** Break exits the loop as soon as the condition is met, useful for search operations.
