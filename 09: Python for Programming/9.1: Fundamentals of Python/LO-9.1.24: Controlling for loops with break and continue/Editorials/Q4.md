## Problem 4: Skip Negative Numbers

**Problem:** Print only positive numbers from a list, skipping negative ones.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [5, -2, 8, -7, 3, -1, 9]

for num in numbers:
    if num < 0:
        continue
    print(num)
```

**Output:**
```
5
8
3
9
```

**Explanation:**
- Loop through all numbers
- If number is negative (`num < 0`), use continue to skip it
- Only positive numbers get printed
- Continue acts as a filter, skipping unwanted values

**Key Concept:** Continue is perfect for filtering out unwanted values while processing the rest.
