## Problem 29: String Pattern Break

**Problem:** Find the first word in a sentence that starts with a capital letter.

**Solution:**
```python
sentence = "hello world Python Programming"
words = sentence.split()

for word in words:
    if word[0].isupper():
        print(f"First capitalized word: {word}")
        break
```

**Output:**
```
First capitalized word: Python
```

**Explanation:**
- Split sentence into words
- Check if first character is uppercase using `.isupper()`
- "hello" → 'h' not uppercase
- "world" → 'w' not uppercase
- "Python" → 'P' is uppercase, print and break
- "Programming" never checked

**Key Concept:** String methods like `.isupper()` work well with break conditions.
