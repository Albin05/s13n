## Problem 17: Validate All Even

**Problem:** Check if all numbers in a list are even. Stop if you find an odd number.

**Solution:**
```python
# List 1
numbers1 = [2, 4, 6, 8]
print("List 1:")
for num in numbers1:
    if num % 2 != 0:
        print(f"Not all even (found {num})")
        break
else:
    print("All numbers are even")

print()

# List 2
numbers2 = [2, 4, 5, 8]
print("List 2:")
for num in numbers2:
    if num % 2 != 0:
        print(f"Not all even (found {num})")
        break
else:
    print("All numbers are even")
```

**Output:**
```
List 1:
All numbers are even

List 2:
Not all even (found 5)
```

**Explanation:**
- Check each number for oddness
- If odd number found, print message and break
- If loop completes (no odd found), else clause prints success
- List 1: All even, loop completes, else executes
- List 2: 5 is odd, break occurs, else doesn't execute
- This validates "all" condition efficiently

**Key Concept:** For-else elegantly handles "all elements match" validation.
