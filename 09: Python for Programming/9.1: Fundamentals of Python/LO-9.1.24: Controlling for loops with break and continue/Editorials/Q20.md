## Problem 20: First Prime Number

**Problem:** Find the first prime number in a list of numbers.

**Solution:**
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

numbers = [4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 15, 17]

for num in numbers:
    if is_prime(num):
        print(f"First prime: {num}")
        break
```

**Output:**
```
First prime: 11
```

**Explanation:**
- Helper function checks if a number is prime
- Loop through each number in the list
- Use helper function to check primality
- 4, 6, 8, 9 are not prime
- 11 is prime (only divisible by 1 and 11)
- Print and break when first prime found
- 15 and 17 are never checked

**Key Concept:** Helper functions can encapsulate complex conditions for break statements.
