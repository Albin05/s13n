## Problem 16: Remove Consecutive Duplicates

**Problem:** Print a list without consecutive duplicates.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
prev = None

for num in numbers:
    if num == prev:
        continue
    print(num, end=' ')
    prev = num
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Explanation:**
- Track previous value with variable
- For each number, check if it equals previous
- If yes, continue skips it (consecutive duplicate)
- If no, print it and update previous
- First 1: prev is None, so print it, prev becomes 1
- Second 1: equals prev, skip it
- First 2: different from prev (1), print it, prev becomes 2
- And so on...

**Key Concept:** Tracking previous values helps detect consecutive patterns.
