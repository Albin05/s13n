### **18. Interactive Search**

Search for multiple targets in a list. For each target, find and print its index. Stop searching if target is not found.

Given list: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`
Targets: `[20, 50, 60]`

**Expected Output:**
```
20 found at index 1
50 found at index 4
60 not found - stopping search
```

**Hint:** Outer loop for targets, inner loop for search, break outer when target not found.
