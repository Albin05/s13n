### **12. Loop with Else**

Search for a number greater than 10 in a list. If found, print it. If not found (loop completes), print "No large number found".

Test with two lists:
- List 1: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
- List 2: `[2, 4, 15, 8]`

**Expected Output:**
```
List 1:
No large number found

List 2:
Found large number: 15
```

**Hint:** Use for-else clause. The else runs only if loop completes without break.
