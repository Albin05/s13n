### **17. Validate All Even**

Check if all numbers in a list are even. If you find an odd number, stop and print "Not all even".

Test with two lists:
- List 1: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
- List 2: `[2, 4, 5, 8]`

**Expected Output:**
```
List 1:
All numbers are even

List 2:
Not all even (found 5)
```

**Hint:** Use for-else with break when odd number found.
