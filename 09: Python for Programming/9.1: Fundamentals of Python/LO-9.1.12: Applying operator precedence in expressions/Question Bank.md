# Question Bank: Apply Operator Precedence

## Problem 1 (Easy)
Predict output without running:
```python
print(5 + 3 * 2)
print(10 - 4 / 2)
print(2 ** 3 + 1)
```

## Problem 2 (Easy)
Add parentheses to get result:
```python
# Make this equal 16
2 + 3 * 4

# Make this equal 20
2 + 3 * 4
```

## Problem 3 (Medium)
Evaluate step by step:
```python
result = 10 + 5 * 2 ** 2 - 3
```

## Problem 4 (Medium)
Fix with parentheses:
```python
# Calculate average
avg = total + count / 2  # Wrong!
# Should add first, then divide
```

## Problem 5 (Hard)
Complex expression:
```python
result = (5 + 3) * 2 ** 2 - 10 // 3 + 1
```
Evaluate step by step.
