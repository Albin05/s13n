### **11. Prime Number Checker with Break**

Check if a number is prime by searching for divisors. Use break to stop as soon as a divisor is found. Use the loop-else pattern.

Test with number: 29

**Expected Output:**
```
29 is prime
```

Test with number: 15

**Expected Output:**
```
15 is not prime
```

**Hint:** Loop from 2 to sqrt(number). If divisor found, print "not prime" and break. Use else clause to print "is prime".
