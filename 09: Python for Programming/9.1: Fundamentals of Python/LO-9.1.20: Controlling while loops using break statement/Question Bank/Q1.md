### **1. Find First Even Number**

Write a program that finds and prints the first even number from a list, then stops.

Given list: `[1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13]`

**Expected Output:**
```
First even number: 8
```

**Hint:** Use a for loop to iterate through the list. When you find an even number (`num % 2 == 0`), print it and use `break` to exit.
