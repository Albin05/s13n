### **8. Password System**

Create a login system with exactly 3 attempts. Correct password is "secret123". If user gets it right, grant access and stop. If all attempts fail, deny access.

**Example Output (correct on 2nd try):**
```
Attempt 1/3
Enter password: wrong
Incorrect

Attempt 2/3
Enter password: secret123
Access granted!
```

**Hint:** Use while loop with attempts counter. Break when correct password entered. Use loop-else for "access denied".
