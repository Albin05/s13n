### **13. Nested Loop with Break**

Find the first pair of numbers whose product equals 24 from two ranges (1-6). Stop searching when found.

**Expected Output:**
```
Found: 4 x 6 = 24
```

**Hint:** Nested loops for i and j. When `i * j == 24`, print result, set flag, break inner loop. Check flag to break outer loop.
