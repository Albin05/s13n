### **7. Sum Until Zero**

Keep asking for numbers and summing them. When user enters 0, stop and show the total.

**Example Interaction:**
```
Enter number (0 to stop): 10
Enter number (0 to stop): 25
Enter number (0 to stop): 15
Enter number (0 to stop): 0
Total sum: 50
```

**Hint:** Use `while True:`, check if number is 0, break and print total.
