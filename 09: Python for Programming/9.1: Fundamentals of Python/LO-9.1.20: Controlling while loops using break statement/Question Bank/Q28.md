### **28. Password Strength Checker**

Keep asking for password until it meets requirements:
- At least 8 characters
- Contains at least one digit
- Contains at least one uppercase letter

**Example:**
```
Enter password: short
Too short! Must be at least 8 characters

Enter password: lowercase
Must contain at least one digit

Enter password: nodigit1
Must contain at least one uppercase letter

Enter password: ValidPass1
Password accepted!
```

**Hint:** Check each requirement, give specific feedback, break when all pass.

## Key Patterns to Practice

1. **Search and Stop**: Find first item matching condition
2. **while True + break**: Clean menu systems
3. **Loop-else**: Detect if break occurred
4. **Nested break**: Use flag variable
5. **Validation**: Keep asking until valid input
6. **Sentinel values**: Stop on special value
7. **Counter with break**: Limited attempts
8. **Early exit**: Stop when threshold reached

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Forgetting to use break (infinite loop in `while True:`)
2. Breaking too early (before processing current item)
3. Assuming break exits all nested loops (only exits innermost)
4. Not handling loop-else correctly (runs when NO break)
5. Breaking without providing feedback to user
