### **20. Search Matrix**

Search for a target value in a 2D matrix (list of lists). Stop searching as soon as you find it.

Given matrix:
```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```
Target: 5

**Expected Output:**
```
Found 5 at row 1, column 1
```

**Hint:** Nested loops for rows and columns. When value found, print position, set flag, break inner loop. Check flag to break outer loop.
