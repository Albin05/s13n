### **25. Collect Until Sentinel**

Collect numbers into a list until user enters -1 (sentinel value). Then print statistics: count, sum, and average.

**Example Interaction:**
```
Enter number (-1 to finish): 10
Enter number (-1 to finish): 20
Enter number (-1 to finish): 30
Enter number (-1 to finish): 40
Enter number (-1 to finish): -1

Statistics:
Count: 4
Sum: 100
Average: 25.0
```

**Hint:** Use `while True:`, append valid numbers to list, break on -1, calculate statistics after loop.
