### **17. Two Sum Problem**

Find two numbers in a list that add up to a target sum. Stop when first pair is found.

Given list: `[2, 7, 11, 15, 3]`
Target sum: 9

**Expected Output:**
```
Found: 2 + 7 = 9
```

**Hint:** Nested loops. Outer loop picks first number, inner loop picks second. Check if sum equals target, use flag to break both loops.
