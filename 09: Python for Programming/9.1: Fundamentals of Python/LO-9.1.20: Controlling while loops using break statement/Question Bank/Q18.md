### **18. Guessing Game with Hints**

Create a number guessing game. Secret number is 42. Give "too high" or "too low" hints. Allow maximum 5 attempts.

**Example Interaction:**
```
Attempt 1/5
Guess the number: 50
Too high!

Attempt 2/5
Guess the number: 30
Too low!

Attempt 3/5
Guess the number: 42

```

**Hint:** Use while loop with attempts counter. Break when correct. Use loop-else to handle "out of attempts" case.
