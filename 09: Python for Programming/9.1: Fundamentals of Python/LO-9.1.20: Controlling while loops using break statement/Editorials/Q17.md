## Problem 17: Process Commands (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
commands = ["add 5", "multiply 2", "stop", "add 10", "divide 2"]
result = 0

for cmd in commands:
    parts = cmd.split()
    operation = parts[0]

    if operation == "stop":
        print("Stop command received")
        break

    value = int(parts[1])

    if operation == "add":
        result += value
    elif operation == "multiply":
        result *= value
    elif operation == "divide":
        result //= value

    print(f"After {cmd}: {result}")

print(f"Final result: {result}")
```

**Output:**
```
After add 5: 5
After multiply 2: 10
Stop command received
Final result: 10
```

### Explanation
- Process list of commands
- Break on "stop" command
- Commands after "stop" ignored
- Result accumulates until break
- Demonstrates command processing pattern
- Early termination based on data
