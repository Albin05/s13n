## Problem 5: User Input Until Quit (Medium)

### Solution
```python
while True:
    command = input("Enter command (or 'quit'): ")

    if command == "quit":
        print("Exiting...")
        break

    print(f"You entered: {command}")

print("Program ended")
```

**Example Interaction:**
```
Enter command (or 'quit'): hello
You entered: hello
Enter command (or 'quit'): world
You entered: world
Enter command (or 'quit'): quit
Exiting...
Program ended
```

### Explanation
- Infinite loop for continuous input
- Check for exit command inside loop
- Break when user wants to quit
- Cleaner than checking condition in while statement
- Processes all commands before checking for quit
