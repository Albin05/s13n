## Problem 7: Password System with Limit (Medium)

### Solution
```python
correct_password = "python123"
max_attempts = 3
attempts = 0

while attempts < max_attempts:
    password = input("Enter password: ")
    attempts += 1

    if password == correct_password:
        print("Access granted!")
        break
    else:
        remaining = max_attempts - attempts
        if remaining > 0:
            print(f"Wrong password. {remaining} attempts remaining")
else:
    print("Too many failed attempts. Account locked.")
```

**Example Output (correct on 2nd try):**
```
Enter password: wrong
Wrong password. 2 attempts remaining
Enter password: python123
Access granted!
```

### Explanation
- Loop while attempts remain
- Break when correct password entered
- `else` clause runs if all attempts exhausted (no break)
- If break happens, else is skipped
- Real-world security pattern
