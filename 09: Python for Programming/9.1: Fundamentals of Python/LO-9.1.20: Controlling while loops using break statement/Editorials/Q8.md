## Problem 8: Find Multiple Conditions (Hard)

### Solution
```python
numbers = [1, 3, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25]

for num in numbers:
    if num > 10 and num % 5 == 0:
        print(f"Found: {num} (>10 and divisible by 5)")
        break
else:
    print("No number found matching criteria")
```

**Output:**
```
Found: 15 (>10 and divisible by 5)
```

### Explanation
- Search for number meeting TWO conditions
- Must be > 10 AND divisible by 5
- Break when both conditions met
- 15 is first to satisfy both
- Demonstrates compound conditions with break
