## Problem 3: Stop at Negative (Easy)

### Solution
```python
numbers = [5, 10, 15, -3, 20, 25]
total = 0

for num in numbers:
    if num < 0:
        print("Negative number encountered, stopping")
        break
    total += num

print(f"Sum before negative: {total}")
```

**Output:**
```
Negative number encountered, stopping
Sum before negative: 30
```

### Explanation
- Sum numbers until negative encountered
- Break when `num < 0`
- Total accumulates: 5 + 10 + 15 = 30
- Numbers after -3 (20, 25) are not processed
- Pattern: stop on sentinel condition
