## Problem 4: Infinite Loop with Break (Medium)

### Solution
```python
count = 0

while True:
    count += 1
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    if count >= 3:
        break

print("Loop exited")
```

**Output:**
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Loop exited
```

### Explanation
- `while True:` creates infinite loop
- **MUST** have break statement to exit
- Loop runs 3 times before breaking
- Common pattern for menu systems
- Break is ONLY way out of `while True`
