## Problem 1: Find First Even Number (Easy)

### Solution
```python
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11]

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"First even number: {num}")
        break
```

**Output:**
```
First even number: 8
```

### Explanation
- Iterate through list until even number found
- `num % 2 == 0` checks if even
- `break` exits loop immediately when condition met
- Remaining elements (9, 11) are never checked
- Efficient: stops as soon as answer found
