## Problem 18: Find All Until Condition (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16]
odd_numbers = []

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"First even number {num} found, stopping")
        break
    odd_numbers.append(num)

print(f"Odd numbers before even: {odd_numbers}")
```

**Output:**
```
First even number 10 found, stopping
Odd numbers before even: [1, 3, 5, 7]
```

### Explanation
- Collect items until condition met
- Break stops collection
- List contains only pre-break items
- Pattern: accumulate until sentinel
- Partial list processing
