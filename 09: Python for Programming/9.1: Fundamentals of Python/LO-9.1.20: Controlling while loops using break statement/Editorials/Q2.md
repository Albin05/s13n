## Problem 2: Search for Target (Easy)

### Solution
```python
target = "apple"
fruits = ["banana", "orange", "apple", "grape"]

found = False
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == target:
        print(f"Found {target}!")
        found = True
        break

if not found:
    print(f"{target} not found")
```

**Output:**
```
Found apple!
```

### Explanation
- Search list for specific item
- Use flag variable to track if found
- Break as soon as target located
- Check flag after loop to handle "not found" case
- Without break, would unnecessarily check remaining items
