## Problem 11: Search Matrix (Hard)

### Solution
```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

target = 5
found = False

for row in matrix:
    for num in row:
        if num == target:
            print(f"Found {target}")
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        break

if not found:
    print(f"{target} not found")
```

**Output:**
```
Found 5
```

### Explanation
- Search 2D matrix for value
- Inner break exits row loop
- Outer break exits matrix loop
- Flag ensures both loops exit
- Stops immediately when found
- Doesn't search remaining rows/columns
