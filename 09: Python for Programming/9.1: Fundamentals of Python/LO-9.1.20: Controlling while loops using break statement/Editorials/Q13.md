## Problem 13: Menu System (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
balance = 1000

while True:
    print(f"\n=== Balance: ${balance} ===")
    print("1. Deposit")
    print("2. Withdraw")
    print("3. Check Balance")
    print("4. Exit")

    choice = input("Choice: ")

    if choice == "1":
        amount = float(input("Deposit amount: $"))
        balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ${amount}")
    elif choice == "2":
        amount = float(input("Withdraw amount: $"))
        if amount <= balance:
            balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount}")
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds")
    elif choice == "3":
        print(f"Current balance: ${balance}")
    elif choice == "4":
        print("Thank you for banking with us!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice")

print(f"Final balance: ${balance}")
```

**Example Output:**
```
=== Balance: $1000 ===
1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Check Balance
4. Exit
Choice: 1
Deposit amount: $500
Deposited $500

=== Balance: $1500 ===
1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Check Balance
4. Exit
Choice: 4
Thank you for banking with us!
Final balance: $1500
```

### Explanation
- Interactive menu with `while True`
- Break when user selects exit
- State (balance) persists across iterations
- Each option performs different action
- Clean exit with break
- Real-world application pattern
