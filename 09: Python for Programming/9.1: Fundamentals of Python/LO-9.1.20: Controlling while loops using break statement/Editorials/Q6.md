## Problem 6: Find Divisor (Medium)

### Solution
```python
number = 100

for i in range(2, number):
    if number % i == 0:
        print(f"First divisor of {number}: {i}")
        break
else:
    print(f"{number} is prime")
```

**Output:**
```
First divisor of 100: 2
```

### Explanation
- Find first divisor of number
- Loop from 2 to number-1
- Break as soon as divisor found
- `else` clause runs if loop completes WITHOUT break
- For 100: 2 divides evenly, so break immediately
- Efficient: doesn't check remaining numbers
