## Problem 9: Nested Loop with Break (Hard)

### Solution
```python
found = False

for i in range(1, 5):
    for j in range(1, 5):
        if i * j == 12:
            print(f"Found: {i} x {j} = 12")
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        break
```

**Output:**
```
Found: 3 x 4 = 12
```

### Explanation
- Nested loops to find product combination
- Inner break exits inner loop only
- Use flag to break outer loop too
- Finds 3 × 4 = 12 and stops
- Without outer break, would find 4 × 3 = 12 too
- Pattern: breaking from nested loops requires flag
