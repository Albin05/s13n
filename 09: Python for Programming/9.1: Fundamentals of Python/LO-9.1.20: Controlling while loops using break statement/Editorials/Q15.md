## Problem 15: Guessing Game with Hints (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
import random

secret = random.randint(1, 100)
attempts = 0
max_attempts = 7

print("Guess the number between 1 and 100!")

while attempts < max_attempts:
    guess = int(input(f"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: "))
    attempts += 1

    if guess == secret:
        print(f"Correct! You won in {attempts} attempts!")
        break
    elif guess < secret:
        diff = secret - guess
        if diff <= 5:
            print("Too low, but very close!")
        else:
            print("Too low")
    else:
        diff = guess - secret
        if diff <= 5:
            print("Too high, but very close!")
        else:
            print("Too high")
else:
    print(f"Game over! The number was {secret}")
```

**Example Output:**
```
Guess the number between 1 and 100!
Attempt 1/7: 50
Too low
Attempt 2/7: 75
Too high
Attempt 3/7: 60
Too low, but very close!
Attempt 4/7: 63
Correct! You won in 4 attempts!
```

### Explanation
- Limited attempts game
- Break when correct guess
- Else clause if all attempts used
- Provides proximity hints
- Demonstrates break vs loop exhaustion
- Game logic with multiple exit paths
