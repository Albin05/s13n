## Problem 19: Timeout Simulation (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
max_iterations = 1000
iterations = 0
found = False

while iterations < max_iterations:
    iterations += 1

    # Simulate search (found on iteration 573)
    if iterations == 573:
        found = True
        print(f"Item found at iteration {iterations}")
        break

    if iterations % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Still searching... {iterations} iterations")

if not found:
    print(f"Search timeout after {max_iterations} iterations")
```

**Output:**
```
Still searching... 100 iterations
Still searching... 200 iterations
Still searching... 300 iterations
Still searching... 400 iterations
Still searching... 500 iterations
Item found at iteration 573
```

### Explanation
- Safety limit prevents infinite loop
- Break when item found
- Progress updates every 100 iterations
- Timeout if not found in time
- Real-world pattern: bounded search
