### LO-1 Define Variables (20 minutes)


### CS Theory Bite

> **Origin**: Variables trace back to **John von Neumann's stored-program architecture** (1945) — the idea that data and instructions live in the same memory, accessed by named addresses.
>
> **Analogy**: A variable is like a **labeled jar in a kitchen** — the label says what's inside, and you can swap the contents anytime without changing the label.
>
> **Why it matters**: Every program manipulates data through variables — they're the foundation of all computation.


### Hook (2 minutes)

**Say**: "Imagine playing a video game. The game needs to remember your score, your character's name, your health - all while you're playing. How does it do that? With variables! Today you'll learn how to make Python remember information."

```python
score = 0
score = score + 100
print(score)  # 100
```

### What are Variables (6 minutes)

**Say**: "A variable is like a labeled box. The label is the variable name, and you put data inside the box."

```python
# Create a variable
age = 25
print(age)  # 25

name = "Alice"
print(name)  # Alice

score = 100
print(score)  # 100
```

**Key Points**:
- Variable name on LEFT, value on RIGHT
- Use `=` to assign (not "equals" like math)
- Read as "age is assigned 25"

### Variable Reassignment (6 minutes)

**Say**: "Unlike math where x = 5 is permanent, in programming variables can change. They're called VARIables because they VARY!"

```python
health = 100
print(health)  # 100

health = 75   # Player took damage!
print(health)  # 75

health = 100  # Player healed!
print(health)  # 100
```

### Student Exercise (4 minutes)

**Say**: "Your turn! Create a variable called `money` with value 100. Then add 50 to it. Then subtract 30. Print it after each step."

```python
# Your code here
money = 100
print(money)

# Add 50

# Subtract 30
```
