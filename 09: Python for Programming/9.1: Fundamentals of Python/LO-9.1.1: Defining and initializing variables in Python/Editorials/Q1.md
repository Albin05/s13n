## Problem 1: Create and Print Variables (Easy)

### Solution
```python
student_name = "Alice"
student_age = 20
student_grade = "A"

print(student_name)
print(student_age)
print(student_grade)
```

### Explanation
- Three separate variables created with different types
- Strings use quotes, numbers don't
- `print()` displays each value
