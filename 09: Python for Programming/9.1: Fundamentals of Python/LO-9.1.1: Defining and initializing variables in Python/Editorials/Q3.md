## Problem 3: Score Tracker (Medium)

### Solution
```python
game_score = 0
print(game_score)

game_score = game_score + 100
print(game_score)

game_score = game_score + 150
print(game_score)

game_score = game_score - 50
print(game_score)
```

### Explanation
- Start with 0
- `game_score = game_score + 100` means: take current value (0), add 100, store result (100)
- Continue updating based on current value
- Final: 0 � 100 � 250 � 200
