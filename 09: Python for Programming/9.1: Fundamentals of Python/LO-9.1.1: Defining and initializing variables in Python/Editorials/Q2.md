## Problem 2: Variable Reassignment (Easy)

### Solution
```python
temperature = 72
print(temperature)

temperature = 68
print(temperature)

temperature = 75
print(temperature)
```

### Explanation
- Same variable name `temperature` used three times
- Each assignment replaces the previous value
- Old values are discarded when reassigned
