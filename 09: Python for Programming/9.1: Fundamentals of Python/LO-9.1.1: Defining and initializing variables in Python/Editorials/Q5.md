## Problem 5: Variable Swap Challenge (Hard)

### Solution
```python
a = 10
b = 20

# Use temporary variable
temp = a    # temp now has 10
a = b       # a now has 20
b = temp    # b now has 10

print("a =", a)
print("b =", b)
```

### Explanation
**Why we need a temporary variable:**
```python
# This doesn't work:
a = b  # a becomes 20, but we lost the original value of a (10)!
b = a  # b becomes 20 (not the original 10)
# Both are now 20!
```

**Correct approach:**
1. Save `a`'s value in `temp` (temp = 10)
2. Copy `b` into `a` (a = 20)
3. Copy `temp` into `b` (b = 10)

**Python shortcut** (advanced):
```python
a, b = b, a  # Swaps in one line!
```
