### **1. Create and Print Variables**

Create three variables:
- `student_name` with your name
- `student_age` with your age
- `student_grade` with a grade (A, B, C, etc.)

Print all three variables.

**Expected Output**:
```
Alice
20
A
```

### **2. Variable Reassignment**

**Expected Output**:
```
72
68
75
```

### **3. Score Tracker**

Create a variable `game_score` starting at 0. Add 100 points (level 1 complete), then add 150 points (level 2 complete), then subtract 50 points (penalty). Print the score after each change.

**Expected Output**:
```
0
100
250

### **4. Shopping Calculator**

Create variables for:
- `item_price = 25`
- `quantity = 3`
- `total` (calculated as price × quantity)

Print the total. Then change quantity to 5 and recalculate total.

**Expected Output**:
```
75
125
```

### **5. Variable Swap Challenge**

You have two variables:
```python
a = 10
b = 20
```

Swap their values so `a` becomes 20 and `b` becomes 10. You'll need a third temporary variable!

**Expected Output**:
```
a = 20
b = 10
```
