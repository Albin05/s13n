### **17. Calculate Shipping Cost with Default Method**

Create a function `calculate_shipping` that takes weight and an optional method with default "standard".
- Standard: $5 per kg
- Express: $10 per kg
- Overnight: $15 per kg

Return the shipping cost.

**Expected Output:**
```python
print(calculate_shipping(2))  # 10.0 (standard)
print(calculate_shipping(2, "express"))  # 20.0 (express)
print(calculate_shipping(3, "overnight"))  # 45.0 (overnight)
```

**Hint:** Use if-elif to determine rate based on method.
