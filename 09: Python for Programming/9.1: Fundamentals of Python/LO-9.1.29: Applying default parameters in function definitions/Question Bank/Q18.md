### **18. Draw Shape with Default Character**

Define a function `draw_line` that takes length and an optional character with default "*". Print a line of that character.

**Expected Output:**
```python
draw_line(5)  # *****
draw_line(3, "#")  # ###
draw_line(10, "-")  # ----------
```

**Hint:** Print `character * length`
