## Problem 25: Calculate Compound Interest with Default Period

**Problem:** Write a function `compound_interest` that takes principal, rate, time, and an optional n (compounds per year) with default 1. Return the final amount.

**Solution:**
```python
def compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n=1):
    # A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
    amount = principal * (1 + rate/100/n) ** (n * time)
    return round(amount, 2)

# Test cases
print(compound_interest(1000, 5, 2))  # 1102.5 (compounded yearly)
print(compound_interest(1000, 5, 2, 4))  # 1104.49 (compounded quarterly)
print(compound_interest(5000, 6, 3))  # 5955.08 (compounded yearly)
print(compound_interest(5000, 6, 3, 12))  # 5983.40 (compounded monthly)
```

**Output:**
```
1102.5
1104.49
5955.08
5983.4
```

**Explanation:**
This function calculates compound interest using the formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- P = principal (initial amount)
- r = annual interest rate (as percentage)
- t = time in years
- n = number of times interest compounds per year

The `n` parameter defaults to 1 (annually compounded), which is a simple and common case. Other common values include:
- 1: Annually
- 4: Quarterly
- 12: Monthly
- 365: Daily

The default of 1 provides a baseline calculation, with more frequent compounding available when specified. More frequent compounding results in slightly higher returns due to earning interest on interest more often.

**Key Concept:** Default parameters in mathematical functions should use standard or baseline values that work for simple calculations while supporting advanced options.
