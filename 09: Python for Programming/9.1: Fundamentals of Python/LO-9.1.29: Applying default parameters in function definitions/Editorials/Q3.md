## Problem 3: Calculate Discount with Default Rate

**Problem:** Define a function `calculate_discount` that takes a price and a discount percentage with a default of 10%. Return the discounted price.

**Solution:**
```python
def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent=10):
    discount_amount = price * discount_percent / 100
    final_price = price - discount_amount
    return final_price

# Test cases
print(calculate_discount(100))  # 90.0 (10% off)
print(calculate_discount(100, 20))  # 80.0 (20% off)
print(calculate_discount(250))  # 225.0 (10% off)
print(calculate_discount(50, 5))  # 47.5 (5% off)
```

**Output:**
```
90.0
80.0
225.0
47.5
```

**Explanation:**
The function calculates the final price after applying a discount. The `discount_percent` parameter has a default value of 10, representing a common discount rate. The calculation:
1. Calculate discount amount: `price * discount_percent / 100`
2. Subtract from original price: `price - discount_amount`

When called with just the price (`calculate_discount(100)`), it uses the default 10% discount. When called with both parameters (`calculate_discount(100, 20)`), it uses the specified discount rate.

**Key Concept:** Default parameters work well for common business rules or standard values that can be overridden when needed.
