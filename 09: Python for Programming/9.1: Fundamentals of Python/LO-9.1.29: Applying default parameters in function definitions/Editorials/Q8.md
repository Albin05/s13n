## Problem 8: Calculate Tax with Default Rate

**Problem:** Create a function `calculate_tax` that takes income and an optional tax_rate with default 15%. Return the tax amount.

**Solution:**
```python
def calculate_tax(income, tax_rate=15):
    tax_amount = income * tax_rate / 100
    return tax_amount

# Test cases
print(calculate_tax(50000))  # 7500.0 (15%)
print(calculate_tax(50000, 20))  # 10000.0 (20%)
print(calculate_tax(100000))  # 15000.0 (15%)
print(calculate_tax(75000, 25))  # 18750.0 (25%)
```

**Output:**
```
7500.0
10000.0
15000.0
18750.0
```

**Explanation:**
This function calculates tax based on income and a tax rate. The `tax_rate` parameter has a default value of 15, representing a standard tax rate percentage. The calculation is straightforward: `income * tax_rate / 100`. When called with just income (`calculate_tax(50000)`), it uses the default 15% rate. When called with both parameters (`calculate_tax(50000, 20)`), it uses the specified rate. This pattern is common in financial calculations where standard rates exist but can vary.

**Key Concept:** Default parameters are ideal for rates, percentages, and factors that have standard values but may need adjustment.
