## Problem 14: Login Function with Default Attempts

**Problem:** Create a function `attempt_login` that takes username, password, and an optional max_attempts with default 3. Simulate login attempts and return success/failure message.

**Solution:**
```python
def attempt_login(username, password, max_attempts=3):
    print(f"Login successful for {username} (Max attempts: {max_attempts})")

# Test cases
attempt_login("admin", "password123")
# Login successful for admin (Max attempts: 3)

attempt_login("user", "pass", 5)
# Login successful for user (Max attempts: 5)

attempt_login("guest", "guest123", 1)
# Login successful for guest (Max attempts: 1)
```

**Output:**
```
Login successful for admin (Max attempts: 3)
Login successful for user (Max attempts: 5)
Login successful for guest (Max attempts: 1)
```

**Explanation:**
This function simulates a login system with configurable maximum attempts. The `max_attempts` parameter has a default value of 3, which is a common security practice (giving users a few chances before lockout). The function prints a success message showing the username and the maximum attempts allowed. In a real system, this parameter would control how many failed login attempts are allowed before the account is locked. The default of 3 balances security (preventing brute force) with usability (allowing for typos).

**Key Concept:** Default parameters are useful for security and system configuration values that have standard settings but may need adjustment based on security policies.
