## Problem 17: Calculate Shipping Cost with Default Method

**Problem:** Create a function `calculate_shipping` that takes weight and an optional method with default "standard". Standard: $5 per kg, Express: $10 per kg, Overnight: $15 per kg. Return the shipping cost.

**Solution:**
```python
def calculate_shipping(weight, method="standard"):
    if method == "standard":
        rate = 5
    elif method == "express":
        rate = 10
    elif method == "overnight":
        rate = 15
    else:
        rate = 5  # Default to standard if unknown method

    cost = weight * rate
    return cost

# Test cases
print(calculate_shipping(2))  # 10.0 (standard)
print(calculate_shipping(2, "express"))  # 20.0 (express)
print(calculate_shipping(3, "overnight"))  # 45.0 (overnight)
print(calculate_shipping(5, "standard"))  # 25.0 (standard)
```

**Output:**
```
10.0
20.0
45.0
25.0
```

**Explanation:**
This function calculates shipping costs based on weight and shipping method. The `method` parameter defaults to "standard" (the most economical and commonly chosen option). The function uses conditional logic to determine the rate per kilogram:
- "standard": $5/kg (default, economical)
- "express": $10/kg (faster, more expensive)
- "overnight": $15/kg (fastest, most expensive)

The cost is calculated by multiplying weight by the rate. The default "standard" method makes the function convenient for regular shipping while supporting premium options when needed. This pattern is common in e-commerce applications.

**Key Concept:** Default parameters can represent standard or economy options in business logic, with upgrades available through explicit specification.
