### **5. Write a comprehensive ATM withdrawal validator:**

- Check if amount > 0 (else: "Invalid amount")
- Check if amount <= balance (else: "Insufficient funds")
- Check if amount % 10 == 0 (else: "Amount must be multiple of 10")
- Else: "Withdrawal successful"

Use nested if-else statements.

Example:
```
Balance: $500
Enter amount: $50
Withdrawal successful
New balance: $450
```
