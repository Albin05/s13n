## Problem 2
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote")
else:
    years_to_wait = 18 - age
    print(f"You cannot vote yet. Wait {years_to_wait} years")
```

### Explanation
- Check voting age (18)
- If not eligible, calculate years remaining
- else provides feedback with calculation
