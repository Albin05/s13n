## Problem 4
```python
weight = float(input("Enter package weight (kg): "))

if weight <= 1:
    cost = 5
elif weight <= 5:
    cost = 10
elif weight <= 10:
    cost = 15
else:
    cost = 25

print(f"Shipping cost: ${cost}")
```

### Explanation
- Check weight brackets in order
- else handles heavy packages (> 10kg)
- Simple and clear pricing logic
