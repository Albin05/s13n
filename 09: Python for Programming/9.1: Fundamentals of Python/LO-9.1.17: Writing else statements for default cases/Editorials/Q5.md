## Problem 5
```python
balance = 500
amount = int(input("Enter amount: "))

print(f"Balance: ${balance}")

if amount <= 0:
    print("Invalid amount")
else:
    if amount > balance:
        print("Insufficient funds")
    else:
        if amount % 10 != 0:
            print("Amount must be multiple of 10")
        else:
            balance = balance - amount
            print("Withdrawal successful")
            print(f"New balance: ${balance}")
```

### Explanation
- Nested if-else statements check conditions sequentially
- First check: amount must be positive
- Second check: sufficient balance
- Third check: multiple of 10
- else: all checks passed, process withdrawal
- Each else narrows down to valid transaction
