### **1. Which variables are valid?**

a) `student_name`
b) `2nd_place`
c) `first-name`  
d) `_private`

---

### **2. Rename using snake_case:**

- `studentName` →
- `TotalScore` →
- `userEmail` →

---

### **3. Fix these invalid names:**

```python
1st_place = "Gold"
user-email = "test@test.com"
for = 10
total$price = 99.99
```

---

### **4. Create variables for a student profile using proper naming:**

- First name
- Last name  
- Age
- GPA
- Is enrolled (boolean)

---

### **5. Identify and explain what's wrong with each:**

```python
user@domain = "test"
className = "Math"
MAX_value = 100
first name = "Alice"
my-var = 50
```
