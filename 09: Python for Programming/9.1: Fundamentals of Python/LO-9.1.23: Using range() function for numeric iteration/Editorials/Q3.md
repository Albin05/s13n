## Problem 3: Sum Numbers 1 to 100 (Easy)

### Solution
```python
total = 0
for num in range(1, 101):
    total += num

print(f"Sum: {total}")
```

**Output:**
```
Sum: 5050
```

### Explanation
- `range(1, 101)` generates 1 through 100
- Each number added to total
- 1+2+3+...+100 = 5050
- Range makes this cleaner than manual counting
- Accumulator pattern with range
