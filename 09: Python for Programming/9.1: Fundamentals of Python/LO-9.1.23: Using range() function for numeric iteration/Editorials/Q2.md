## Problem 2: Count to 5 (Easy)

### Solution
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

### Explanation
- Single argument: `range(5)` means start at 0, stop before 5
- Equivalent to `range(0, 5)`
- Default start is 0
- Generates 5 numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Common pattern for counting iterations
