## Problem 5: Countdown from 10 (Medium)

### Solution
```python
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i)
print("Blast off!")
```

**Output:**
```
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
Blast off!
```

### Explanation
- Start at 10, stop before 0, step by -1
- **Negative step** counts backwards
- Stops at 1 (doesn't include 0)
- Perfect for countdown sequences
- Cleaner than manual decrementing
