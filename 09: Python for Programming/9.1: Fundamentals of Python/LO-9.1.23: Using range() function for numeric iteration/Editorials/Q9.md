## Problem 9: Nested Range Loops (Hard)

### Solution
```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(f"({i}, {j})", end=" ")
    print()  # New line after each row
```

**Output:**
```
(1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3)
(2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3)
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3)
```

### Explanation
- Outer range: i = 1, 2, 3
- Inner range: j = 1, 2, 3 for each i
- Creates 3×3 grid of coordinates
- Nested ranges for 2D iteration
- Total 9 combinations
