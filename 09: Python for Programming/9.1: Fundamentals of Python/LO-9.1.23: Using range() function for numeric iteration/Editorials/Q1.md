## Problem 1: Count to 10 (Easy)

### Solution
```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

### Explanation
- `range(1, 11)` generates numbers from 1 to 10
- Stop value (11) is **exclusive** - not included
- Start value (1) is **inclusive** - included
- Default step is 1
- Cleaner than `while i <= 10` approach
