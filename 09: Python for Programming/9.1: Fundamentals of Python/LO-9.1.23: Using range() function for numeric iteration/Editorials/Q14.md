## Problem 14: Factorial with Range (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
n = 5
factorial = 1

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial *= i

print(f"{n}! = {factorial}")
```

**Output:**
```
5! = 120
```

### Explanation
- Range 1 to n (inclusive)
- Multiply: 1 × 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120
- Range replaces manual counting
- Clean, readable code
- Standard factorial algorithm
