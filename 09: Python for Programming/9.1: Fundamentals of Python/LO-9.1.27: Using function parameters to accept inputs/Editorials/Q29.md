## Problem 29: Leap Year Checker

**Problem:** Define a function `check_leap_year` that takes a `year` parameter.

**Solution:**
```python
def check_leap_year(year):
    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
        print(f"{year} is a leap year")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is not a leap year")

# Test cases
check_leap_year(2024)
check_leap_year(2023)
```

**Output:**
```
2024 is a leap year
2023 is not a leap year
```

**Explanation:**
- Parameter `year` tested against leap year rules
- Rule: divisible by 4 AND (not divisible by 100 OR divisible by 400)
- 2024: divisible by 4, not by 100 → leap year
- 2023: not divisible by 4 → not leap year
- Complex logical condition with `and`, `or`, `not`
- Parentheses group conditions correctly

**Key Concept:** Parameters can be used in complex boolean expressions with multiple operators.
