## Problem 13: Discount Calculator

**Problem:** Write a function `apply_discount` that takes `price` and `discount_percent` and prints the final price.

**Solution:**
```python
def apply_discount(price, discount_percent):
    discount_amount = price * discount_percent / 100
    final_price = price - discount_amount
    print(f"Final price: ${final_price}")

# Test cases
apply_discount(100, 10)
apply_discount(250, 20)
apply_discount(80, 15)
```

**Output:**
```
Final price: $90.0
Final price: $200.0
Final price: $68.0
```

**Explanation:**
- `price` = original price, `discount_percent` = percentage off
- First: $100 with 10% off = $100 - $10 = $90
- Second: $250 with 20% off = $250 - $50 = $200
- Third: $80 with 15% off = $80 - $12 = $68
- Parameters used in multi-step calculation
- Both parameters contribute to the final result

**Key Concept:** Parameters can represent different aspects of a problem (amount and percentage).
