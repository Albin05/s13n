## Problem 20: Fizz Buzz Function

**Problem:** Define a function `fizz_buzz_single` that takes a `number` and prints Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, or the number.

**Solution:**
```python
def fizz_buzz_single(number):
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(number)

# Test cases
fizz_buzz_single(3)
fizz_buzz_single(5)
fizz_buzz_single(15)
fizz_buzz_single(7)
```

**Output:**
```
Fizz
Buzz
FizzBuzz
7
```

**Explanation:**
- Parameter `number` is tested against multiple conditions
- 3: divisible by 3 → Fizz
- 5: divisible by 5 → Buzz
- 15: divisible by both 3 and 5 → FizzBuzz
- 7: not divisible by 3 or 5 → print the number itself
- Order matters: check both conditions first
- Classic programming problem using conditionals

**Key Concept:** Multiple conditions can be checked in priority order using if-elif-else.
