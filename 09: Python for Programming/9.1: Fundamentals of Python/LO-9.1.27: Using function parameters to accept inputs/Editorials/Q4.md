## Problem 4: Three Number Multiplier

**Problem:** Write a function `multiply_three` that takes three parameters and prints their product.

**Solution:**
```python
def multiply_three(num1, num2, num3):
    product = num1 * num2 * num3
    print(f"Product: {product}")

# Test cases
multiply_three(2, 3, 4)
multiply_three(5, 5, 2)
```

**Output:**
```
Product: 24
Product: 50
```

**Explanation:**
- Function accepts three parameters
- First call: 2 × 3 × 4 = 24
- Second call: 5 × 5 × 2 = 50
- All three parameters are multiplied together
- You can have as many parameters as needed (though too many makes it complex)

**Key Concept:** Functions can accept multiple parameters. Each parameter is separated by a comma.
