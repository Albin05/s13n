### **20. Fizz Buzz Function**

Define a function `fizz_buzz_single` that takes a `number` and prints Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, or the number.

**Expected Output:**
```python
fizz_buzz_single(3)   # Fizz
fizz_buzz_single(5)   # Buzz
fizz_buzz_single(15)  # FizzBuzz
fizz_buzz_single(7)   # 7
```

**Hint:** Divisible by 3 and 5 = FizzBuzz, by 3 = Fizz, by 5 = Buzz
