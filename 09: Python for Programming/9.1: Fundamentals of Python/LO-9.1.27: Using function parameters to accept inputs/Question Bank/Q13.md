### **13. Discount Calculator**

Write a function `apply_discount` that takes `price` and `discount_percent` and prints the final price.

**Expected Output:**
```python
apply_discount(100, 10)   # Final price: $90.0
apply_discount(250, 20)   # Final price: $200.0
apply_discount(80, 15)    # Final price: $68.0
```

**Hint:** Final = price - (price × discount_percent / 100)
