## Problem 3
```python
score = int(input("Enter exam score: "))
submitted = input("Was assignment submitted? (yes/no): ").lower() == "yes"

passed = score >= 60 and submitted
excellent = score >= 90 and submitted

print(f"Passed: {passed}")
print(f"Excellent: {excellent}")
```

### Explanation
- Get score and submission status
- For passing: need score >= 60 AND assignment submitted
- For excellent: need score >= 90 AND assignment submitted
- Both require assignment to be submitted (using `and`)
