## Problem 1
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
has_license = input("Do you have a license? (yes/no): ").lower() == "yes"

can_drive = age >= 18 and has_license
print(f"Can drive: {can_drive}")
```

### Explanation
- Get age as integer
- Get license status and convert to boolean by comparing with "yes"
- Use `and` to check both conditions must be true
- Print result
