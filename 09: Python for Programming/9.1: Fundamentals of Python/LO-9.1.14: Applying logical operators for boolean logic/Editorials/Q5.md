## Problem 5
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
has_parent = input("Is parent with you? (yes/no): ").lower() == "yes"
rating = input("Movie rating (G/PG/PG13/R): ").upper()

# Determine if can watch based on rating
if rating == "G" or rating == "PG":
    can_watch = True
elif rating == "PG13":
    can_watch = age >= 13 or has_parent
elif rating == "R":
    can_watch = age >= 17 or (age >= 13 and has_parent)
else:
    can_watch = False

print(f"Can watch movie: {can_watch}")
```

### Explanation
- Get age, parent presence, and movie rating
- For G and PG: anyone can watch
- For PG13: must be 13+ OR have parent (using `or`)
- For R: must be 17+ OR (13+ AND have parent)
  - The second condition uses `and` inside `or`
- Print final result

**Note**: This solution uses `if/elif/else` which will be covered in the next LO. 

### Alternative Without If Statements
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
has_parent = input("Is parent with you? (yes/no): ").lower() == "yes"
rating = input("Movie rating (G/PG/PG13/R): ").upper()

# Calculate for each rating
can_watch_g = rating == "G"
can_watch_pg = rating == "PG"
can_watch_pg13 = rating == "PG13" and (age >= 13 or has_parent)
can_watch_r = rating == "R" and (age >= 17 or (age >= 13 and has_parent))

# Combine all conditions with OR
can_watch = can_watch_g or can_watch_pg or can_watch_pg13 or can_watch_r

print(f"Can watch movie: {can_watch}")
```

### Explanation for Alternative
- Create a boolean variable for each rating type
- For PG13 and R, combine rating check with age/parent conditions
- Use `or` to combine all possibilities
- Only one needs to be True for can_watch to be True
