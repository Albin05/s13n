### **5. Write a program that determines if someone can watch a movie:**

1. Take age, has parent with them (yes/no), and movie rating (G/PG/PG13/R)
2. Rules:
   - G: Anyone can watch
   - PG: Anyone can watch
   - PG13: Age >= 13 OR has parent
   - R: Age >= 17 OR (age >= 13 AND has parent)
3. Print if they can watch

Example:
```
Enter your age: 15
Is parent with you? (yes/no): no
Movie rating (G/PG/PG13/R): PG13
Can watch movie: True
```

Hint: Use multiple `and`/`or` combinations!
