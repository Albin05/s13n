### **5. Write a tax calculator based on income brackets:**

- $0 - $10,000: 0% tax
- $10,001 - $40,000: 10% tax
- $40,001 - $85,000: 20% tax
- $85,001 - $160,000: 30% tax
- Above $160,000: 40% tax

Calculate and print the tax amount.

Example:
```
Enter annual income: 50000
Tax bracket: 20%
Tax amount: $10000.00
```

Hint: Use elif to determine the bracket, then calculate tax!
