### **3. Write a traffic fine calculator:**

- If speed <= speed_limit: "No fine"
- Elif speed <= speed_limit + 10: "Warning"
- Elif speed <= speed_limit + 20: "Fine: $50"
- Elif speed <= speed_limit + 30: "Fine: $100"
- Else: "Fine: $200 and court appearance"

Take speed limit and actual speed as inputs.

Example:
```
Enter speed limit: 60
Enter your speed: 75
Fine: $50
```
