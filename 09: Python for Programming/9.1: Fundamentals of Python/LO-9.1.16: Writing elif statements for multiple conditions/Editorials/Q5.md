## Problem 5
```python
income = float(input("Enter annual income: "))

if income <= 10000:
    tax_rate = 0
    bracket = "0%"
elif income <= 40000:
    tax_rate = 0.10
    bracket = "10%"
elif income <= 85000:
    tax_rate = 0.20
    bracket = "20%"
elif income <= 160000:
    tax_rate = 0.30
    bracket = "30%"
else:
    tax_rate = 0.40
    bracket = "40%"

tax_amount = income * tax_rate

print(f"Tax bracket: {bracket}")
print(f"Tax amount: ${tax_amount:.2f}")
```

### Explanation
- Check income brackets from lowest to highest
- Store both tax rate and bracket name
- Calculate tax after determining bracket
- Use f-string with :.2f for currency formatting
- Each elif represents a different tax bracket

### Alternative Solution (More Detailed)
```python
income = float(input("Enter annual income: "))

if income <= 10000:
    tax_rate = 0.0
    tax_amount = income * tax_rate
    print("Tax bracket: 0%")
elif income <= 40000:
    tax_rate = 0.10
    tax_amount = income * tax_rate
    print("Tax bracket: 10%")
elif income <= 85000:
    tax_rate = 0.20
    tax_amount = income * tax_rate
    print("Tax bracket: 20%")
elif income <= 160000:
    tax_rate = 0.30
    tax_amount = income * tax_rate
    print("Tax bracket: 30%")
else:
    tax_rate = 0.40
    tax_amount = income * tax_rate
    print("Tax bracket: 40%")

print(f"Tax amount: ${tax_amount:.2f}")
```
