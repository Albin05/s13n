## Problem 1
```python
chest = int(input("Enter chest measurement (inches): "))

if chest >= 42:
    print("Size: XL")
elif chest >= 38:
    print("Size: L")
elif chest >= 34:
    print("Size: M")
elif chest >= 30:
    print("Size: S")
else:
    print("Size: XS")
```

### Explanation
- Check from largest to smallest size
- Each elif checks next smaller size
- else catches anything under 30 inches
- Only one size prints
