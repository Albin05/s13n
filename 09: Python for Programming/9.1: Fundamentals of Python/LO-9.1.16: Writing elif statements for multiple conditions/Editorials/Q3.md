## Problem 3
```python
speed_limit = int(input("Enter speed limit: "))
speed = int(input("Enter your speed: "))

if speed <= speed_limit:
    print("No fine")
elif speed <= speed_limit + 10:
    print("Warning")
elif speed <= speed_limit + 20:
    print("Fine: $50")
elif speed <= speed_limit + 30:
    print("Fine: $100")
else:
    print("Fine: $200 and court appearance")
```

### Explanation
- Check in order from no violation to severe
- Each elif adds 10 mph to the threshold
- else catches extreme speeding (30+ over limit)
- Order is crucial for correct categorization
