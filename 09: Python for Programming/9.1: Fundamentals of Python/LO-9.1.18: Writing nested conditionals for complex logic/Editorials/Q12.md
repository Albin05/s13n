## Problem 12: Loan Approval System (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
credit_score = 720
annual_income = 65000
existing_debt = 15000
employment_years = 3

debt_to_income = existing_debt / annual_income

if credit_score >= 700:
    if debt_to_income < 0.3:
        if employment_years >= 2:
            loan_approved = True
            interest_rate = 3.5
        else:
            if annual_income >= 70000:
                loan_approved = True
                interest_rate = 4.0
            else:
                loan_approved = False
                reason = "Insufficient employment history"
    else:
        if credit_score >= 750 and annual_income >= 80000:
            loan_approved = True
            interest_rate = 4.5
        else:
            loan_approved = False
            reason = "Debt-to-income ratio too high"
else:
    loan_approved = False
    reason = "Credit score too low"

if loan_approved:
    print("Loan approved!")
    print(f"Interest rate: {interest_rate}%")
else:
    print("Loan denied")
    print(f"Reason: {reason}")
```

**Output:**
```
Loan approved!
Interest rate: 3.5%
```

### Explanation
- Complex approval criteria:
  - Credit score >= 700
  - Debt-to-income ratio < 30%
  - Employment >= 2 years OR income >= 70k
- Special case: high credit (750+) and income (80k+) can override debt ratio
- Interest rates based on risk level (3.5% - 4.5%)
- Provides specific denial reasons
- Nested structure implements multi-factor decision tree
