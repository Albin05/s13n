## Problem 5: Restaurant Bill Calculator (Medium)

### Solution
```python
bill_amount = 120
num_people = 4
service_quality = "good"

if num_people > 0:
    if service_quality == "excellent":
        tip_percent = 0.20
    elif service_quality == "good":
        tip_percent = 0.15
    else:
        tip_percent = 0.10

    tip = bill_amount * tip_percent
    total = bill_amount + tip
    per_person = total / num_people

    print(f"Tip: ${tip:.2f}")
    print(f"Total: ${total:.2f}")
    print(f"Per person: ${per_person:.2f}")
else:
    print("Number of people must be positive")
```

**Output:**
```
Tip: $18.00
Total: $138.00
Per person: $34.50
```

### Explanation
- Validates num_people is positive before calculations
- Nested conditions determine tip percentage based on service quality
- Calculates tip, total, and per-person amounts
- Provides formatted output with 2 decimal places
- Prevents division by zero
