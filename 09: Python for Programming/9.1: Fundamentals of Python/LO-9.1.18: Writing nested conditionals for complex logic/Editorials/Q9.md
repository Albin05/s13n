## Problem 9: Parking Fee Calculator (Hard)

### Solution
```python
hours = 5
vehicle_type = "car"
is_weekend = True

if vehicle_type == "motorcycle":
    base_rate = 2
elif vehicle_type == "car":
    base_rate = 5
else:
    base_rate = 10  # truck/van

if hours > 0:
    if hours <= 2:
        fee = base_rate * hours
    else:
        if is_weekend:
            # Weekend discount: first 2 hours regular, rest 50% off
            fee = (base_rate * 2) + (base_rate * 0.5 * (hours - 2))
        else:
            # Weekday: first 2 hours regular, rest full rate
            fee = base_rate * hours

    print(f"Parking fee: ${fee:.2f}")
else:
    print("Invalid hours")
```

**Output:**
```
Parking fee: $17.50
```

### Explanation
- Calculation: (5 * 2) + (5 * 0.5 * 3) = 10 + 7.5 = $17.50
- Three factors: vehicle type, hours, weekend status
- Pricing logic:
  - First 2 hours: base rate
  - Additional hours: weekend gets 50% discount
- Base rates: motorcycle $2, car $5, truck $10
- Nested structure handles complex pricing rules
