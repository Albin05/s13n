## Problem 11: Online Shopping Discount (Hard)

### Solution
```python
is_member = True
cart_total = 150
num_items = 8
is_first_purchase = False

if is_member:
    if cart_total >= 100:
        if num_items >= 5:
            discount = 0.25  # 25% off
        else:
            discount = 0.15  # 15% off
    else:
        discount = 0.10  # 10% off
else:
    if is_first_purchase:
        discount = 0.10  # 10% off for first-time buyers
    else:
        discount = 0  # No discount

final_price = cart_total * (1 - discount)
savings = cart_total * discount

print(f"Original: ${cart_total:.2f}")
print(f"Discount: {discount * 100:.0f}%")
print(f"Savings: ${savings:.2f}")
print(f"Final price: ${final_price:.2f}")
```

**Output:**
```
Original: $150.00
Discount: 25%
Savings: $37.50
Final price: $112.50
```

### Explanation
- Discount rules:
  - Member + $100+ + 5+ items → 25%
  - Member + $100+ → 15%
  - Member → 10%
  - Non-member first purchase → 10%
  - Non-member → 0%
- Nested structure implements tiered discount system
- Calculates and displays savings
