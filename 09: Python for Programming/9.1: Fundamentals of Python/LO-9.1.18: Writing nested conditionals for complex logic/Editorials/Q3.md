## Problem 3: Movie Ticket Pricing (Easy)

### Solution
```python
age = 15
is_student = True

if age < 18:
    if is_student:
        price = 5
    else:
        price = 7
else:
    if is_student:
        price = 8
    else:
        price = 10

print(f"Ticket price: ${price}")
```

**Output:**
```
Ticket price: $5
```

### Explanation
- Outer condition splits by age (under 18 vs 18+)
- Inner conditions check student status
- Pricing matrix:
  - Child student: $5
  - Child non-student: $7
  - Adult student: $8
  - Adult non-student: $10
- Nested structure handles all 4 combinations
