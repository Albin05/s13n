## Problem 14: Insurance Premium Calculator (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
age = 28
has_accidents = False
years_driving = 8
vehicle_value = 25000
has_security_system = True

# Base premium
base_premium = 800

if age < 25:
    age_multiplier = 1.5
elif age < 30:
    age_multiplier = 1.2
else:
    age_multiplier = 1.0

if has_accidents:
    if years_driving < 5:
        accident_multiplier = 1.8
    else:
        accident_multiplier = 1.4
else:
    if years_driving >= 5:
        accident_multiplier = 0.9
    else:
        accident_multiplier = 1.0

if vehicle_value > 30000:
    vehicle_multiplier = 1.3
elif vehicle_value > 20000:
    vehicle_multiplier = 1.1
else:
    vehicle_multiplier = 1.0

if has_security_system:
    security_discount = 0.1
else:
    security_discount = 0

premium = base_premium * age_multiplier * accident_multiplier * vehicle_multiplier
premium = premium * (1 - security_discount)

print(f"Annual premium: ${premium:.2f}")
```

**Output:**
```
Annual premium: $950.40
```

### Explanation
- Calculation: 800 * 1.2 * 0.9 * 1.1 * 0.9 = $950.40
- Five factors affecting premium:
  - Age: younger drivers pay more
  - Accidents: increases premium significantly
  - Driving experience: experienced drivers get discount
  - Vehicle value: expensive cars cost more to insure
  - Security system: 10% discount
- Nested structure calculates multipliers independently
- Final premium is product of all factors
- Real-world insurance pricing model
