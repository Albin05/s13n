## Problem 6: Student Scholarship Eligibility (Medium)

### Solution
```python
gpa = 3.8
income = 45000
extracurricular = True

if gpa >= 3.0:
    if income < 50000:
        if extracurricular:
            scholarship = "Full scholarship"
        else:
            scholarship = "Partial scholarship"
    else:
        if extracurricular and gpa >= 3.5:
            scholarship = "Partial scholarship"
        else:
            scholarship = "Not eligible"
else:
    scholarship = "Not eligible"

print(scholarship)
```

**Output:**
```
Full scholarship
```

### Explanation
- Three criteria: GPA, income, extracurricular activities
- Scholarship rules:
  - GPA >= 3.0 AND income < 50k AND extracurricular → Full
  - GPA >= 3.0 AND income < 50k → Partial
  - GPA >= 3.5 AND income >= 50k AND extracurricular → Partial
  - Otherwise → Not eligible
- Nested structure implements complex eligibility logic
