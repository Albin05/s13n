## Problem 10: Student Performance Report (Hard)

### Solution
```python
attendance = 85
assignment_avg = 78
exam_score = 82

if attendance >= 75:
    if assignment_avg >= 70:
        if exam_score >= 80:
            status = "Excellent"
            recommendation = "Keep up the great work!"
        elif exam_score >= 60:
            status = "Good"
            recommendation = "Focus on exam preparation"
        else:
            status = "At risk"
            recommendation = "Attend tutoring sessions"
    else:
        status = "At risk"
        recommendation = "Complete missing assignments"
else:
    status = "Critical"
    recommendation = "Meet with academic advisor immediately"

print(f"Status: {status}")
print(f"Recommendation: {recommendation}")
```

**Output:**
```
Status: Excellent
Recommendation: Keep up the great work!
```

### Explanation
- Three performance metrics: attendance, assignments, exam
- Status categories:
  - Excellent: all metrics good
  - Good: attendance and assignments good, exam needs work
  - At risk: one metric failing
  - Critical: poor attendance
- Provides personalized recommendations
- Nested structure prioritizes attendance first
