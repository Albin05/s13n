## Problem 2: Grade Calculator with Pass/Fail (Easy)

### Solution
```python
score = 75

if score >= 0 and score <= 100:
    if score >= 50:
        if score >= 90:
            print("Grade: A (Pass)")
        elif score >= 80:
            print("Grade: B (Pass)")
        elif score >= 70:
            print("Grade: C (Pass)")
        else:
            print("Grade: D (Pass)")
    else:
        print("Grade: F (Fail)")
else:
    print("Invalid score")
```

**Output:**
```
Grade: C (Pass)
```

### Explanation
- First condition validates score is between 0 and 100
- Second level checks if student passed (>= 50)
- Third level assigns letter grade based on score ranges
- Nested structure ensures: validation → pass/fail → grade assignment
- Clear hierarchy prevents invalid grades
