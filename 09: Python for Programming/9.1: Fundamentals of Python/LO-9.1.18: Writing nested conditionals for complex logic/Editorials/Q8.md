## Problem 8: Access Control System (Hard)

### Solution
```python
has_keycard = True
pin_correct = True
is_business_hours = False
is_authorized_personnel = True

if has_keycard:
    if pin_correct:
        if is_business_hours:
            print("Access granted")
        else:
            if is_authorized_personnel:
                print("Access granted (after-hours)")
            else:
                print("Access denied: Not authorized for after-hours")
    else:
        print("Access denied: Incorrect PIN")
else:
    print("Access denied: No keycard")
```

**Output:**
```
Access granted (after-hours)
```

### Explanation
- Four levels of security checks:
  1. Keycard present
  2. PIN correct
  3. Business hours or authorized personnel
- Access rules:
  - Business hours: keycard + PIN
  - After hours: keycard + PIN + authorized personnel
- Provides specific denial reasons for debugging
- Implements defense-in-depth security
