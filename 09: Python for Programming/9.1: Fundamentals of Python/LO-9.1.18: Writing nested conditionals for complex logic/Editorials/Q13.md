## Problem 13: Game Difficulty Selector (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
player_level = 15
wins = 45
losses = 20
average_score = 8500

if player_level >= 10:
    win_rate = wins / (wins + losses)

    if win_rate >= 0.7:
        if average_score >= 9000:
            difficulty = "Expert"
            bonus_xp = 1.5
        else:
            difficulty = "Advanced"
            bonus_xp = 1.3
    elif win_rate >= 0.5:
        if average_score >= 7500:
            difficulty = "Intermediate"
            bonus_xp = 1.2
        else:
            difficulty = "Beginner+"
            bonus_xp = 1.1
    else:
        difficulty = "Beginner"
        bonus_xp = 1.0
else:
    difficulty = "Tutorial"
    bonus_xp = 1.0

print(f"Recommended difficulty: {difficulty}")
print(f"XP bonus multiplier: {bonus_xp}x")
```

**Output:**
```
Recommended difficulty: Intermediate
XP bonus multiplier: 1.2x
```

### Explanation
- Calculation: win_rate = 45/(45+20) = 0.69 (69%)
- Three factors: level, win rate, average score
- Difficulty tiers:
  - Expert: level 10+, 70%+ wins, 9000+ score
  - Advanced: level 10+, 70%+ wins
  - Intermediate: level 10+, 50%+ wins, 7500+ score
  - Beginner+: level 10+, 50%+ wins
  - Beginner: level 10+, under 50% wins
  - Tutorial: under level 10
- Bonus XP encourages harder difficulties
- Nested structure ensures balanced matchmaking
