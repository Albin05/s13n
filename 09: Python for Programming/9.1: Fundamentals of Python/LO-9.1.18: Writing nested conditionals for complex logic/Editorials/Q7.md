## Problem 7: Temperature and Weather Advisory (Medium)

### Solution
```python
temperature = 95
humidity = 70

if temperature > 90:
    if humidity > 60:
        print("Heat advisory: Dangerous conditions")
        print("Stay indoors and drink water")
    else:
        print("Hot weather: Exercise caution")
elif temperature < 32:
    if humidity > 50:
        print("Freezing rain possible")
    else:
        print("Cold weather: Dress warmly")
else:
    print("Pleasant weather")
```

**Output:**
