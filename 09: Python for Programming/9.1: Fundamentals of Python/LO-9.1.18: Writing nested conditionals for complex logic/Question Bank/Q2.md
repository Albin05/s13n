### **2. Grade Calculator with Pass/Fail**

Write a program that assigns letter grades and pass/fail status. If score is valid (0-100):
- A: 90-100 (Pass)
- B: 80-89 (Pass)
- C: 70-79 (Pass)
- D: 60-69 (Pass)
- F: Below 60 (Fail)

If score is invalid, print "Invalid score".

Test with score = 85.

**Expected Output:**
```
Grade: B (Pass)
```

**Hint:** Outer if validates range, first inner if checks pass/fail, second inner if assigns grade.
