### **4. Login Validation**

Write a login system that checks:
1. Is username provided?
2. Is password provided?
3. Does username match "admin"?
4. Does password match "secret123"?

Provide specific error messages for each failure point.

Test with username = "admin", password = "secret123".

**Expected Output:**
```
Login successful
```

**Hint:** Use 4 levels of nesting, one for each check. Provide specific error in each else.
