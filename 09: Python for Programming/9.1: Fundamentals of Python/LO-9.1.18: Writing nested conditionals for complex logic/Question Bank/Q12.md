### **12. Loan Approval System**

Approve loan based on multiple criteria:
- If credit_score >= 700:
  - If debt_to_income < 0.3:
    - If employment_years >= 2 → Approve at 3.5%
    - Else:
      - If annual_income >= $70k → Approve at 4.0%
      - Else → Deny: "Insufficient employment history"
  - Else:
    - If credit_score >= 750 AND income >= $80k → Approve at 4.5%
    - Else → Deny: "Debt-to-income ratio too high"
- Else → Deny: "Credit score too low"

Test with credit_score = 720, annual_income = 65000, existing_debt = 15000, employment_years = 3.

**Expected Output:**
```
Loan approved!
Interest rate: 3.5%
```

**Hint:** Calculate debt_to_income first, then use multi-level nesting with specific denial reasons.
