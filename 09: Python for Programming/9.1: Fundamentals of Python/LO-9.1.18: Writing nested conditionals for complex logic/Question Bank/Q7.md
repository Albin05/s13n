### **7. Temperature and Weather Advisory**

Issue weather advisories based on temperature and humidity:
- If temp > 90:
  - If humidity > 60 → "Heat advisory: Dangerous conditions"
  - Else → "Hot weather: Exercise caution"
- If temp < 32:
  - If humidity > 50 → "Freezing rain possible"
  - Else → "Cold weather: Dress warmly"
- Else → "Pleasant weather"

Test with temperature = 95, humidity = 70.

**Expected Output:**
```
Heat advisory: Dangerous conditions
Stay indoors and drink water
```

**Hint:** Use elif for temperature ranges, nested if for humidity checks.
