### **13. Game Difficulty Selector**

Recommend game difficulty based on player stats:
- If player_level >= 10:
  - Calculate win_rate = wins / (wins + losses)
  - If win_rate >= 0.7:
    - If average_score >= 9000 → "Expert" (1.5x XP)
    - Else → "Advanced" (1.3x XP)
  - Elif win_rate >= 0.5:
    - If average_score >= 7500 → "Intermediate" (1.2x XP)
    - Else → "Beginner+" (1.1x XP)
  - Else → "Beginner" (1.0x XP)
- Else → "Tutorial" (1.0x XP)

Test with player_level = 15, wins = 45, losses = 20, average_score = 8500.

**Expected Output:**
```
Recommended difficulty: Intermediate
XP bonus multiplier: 1.2x
```

**Hint:** Calculate win_rate first, use nested structure for difficulty tiers.
