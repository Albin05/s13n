### **9. Parking Fee Calculator**

Calculate parking fee based on:
- Vehicle type: motorcycle ($2/hr), car ($5/hr), truck ($10/hr)
- Hours parked
- Weekend discount: After 2 hours, remaining hours are 50% off on weekends

Formula for weekend: (base_rate × 2) + (base_rate × 0.5 × (hours - 2))

Test with hours = 5, vehicle_type = "car", is_weekend = True.

**Expected Output:**
```
Parking fee: $17.50
```

**Hint:** Set base rate first, then calculate fee using nested if for hours and weekend.
