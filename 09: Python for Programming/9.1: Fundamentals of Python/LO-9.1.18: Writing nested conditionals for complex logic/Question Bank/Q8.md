### **8. Access Control System**

Implement a 4-level security system:
- Has keycard?
  - PIN correct?
    - Is business hours?
      - Grant access
    - Else:
      - Is authorized personnel?
        - Grant access (after-hours)
      - Else:
        - Deny: Not authorized for after-hours

Provide specific denial reasons.

Test with has_keycard = True, pin_correct = True, is_business_hours = False, is_authorized_personnel = True.

**Expected Output:**
```
Access granted (after-hours)
```

**Hint:** Four levels of nesting with specific messages at each failure point.
