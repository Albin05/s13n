### **14. Insurance Premium Calculator**

Calculate annual insurance premium with multiple factors:
- Age multiplier:
  - Under 25: 1.5x
  - 25-29: 1.2x
  - 30+: 1.0x
- Accident history:
  - If has_accidents:
    - If years_driving < 5 → 1.8x
    - Else → 1.4x
  - Else:
    - If years_driving >= 5 → 0.9x
    - Else → 1.0x
- Vehicle value:
  - Over $30k: 1.3x
  - $20k-$30k: 1.1x
  - Under $20k: 1.0x
- Security system: -10% discount

Base premium: $800
Formula: base × age_mult × accident_mult × vehicle_mult × (1 - security_discount)

Test with age = 28, has_accidents = False, years_driving = 8, vehicle_value = 25000, has_security_system = True.

**Expected Output:**
```
Annual premium: $950.40
```

**Hint:** Calculate each multiplier independently using nested ifs, then combine at end.
