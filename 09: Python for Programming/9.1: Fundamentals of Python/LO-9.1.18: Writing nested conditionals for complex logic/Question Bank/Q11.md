### **11. Online Shopping Discount**

Calculate discount based on membership and cart:
- If member:
  - If cart_total >= $100:
    - If num_items >= 5 → 25% off
    - Else → 15% off
  - Else → 10% off
- Else:
  - If first_purchase → 10% off
  - Else → No discount

Calculate final price and savings.

Test with is_member = True, cart_total = 150, num_items = 8, is_first_purchase = False.

**Expected Output:**
```
Original: $150.00
Discount: 25%
Savings: $37.50
Final price: $112.50
```

**Hint:** Nested structure for tiered discounts, calculate savings at end.
