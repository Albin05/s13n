### **18. Tax Bracket Calculator**

Calculate income tax based on complex brackets:
- If income <= $10,000 → 0% tax
- Elif income <= $40,000:
  - If has_dependents:
    - If num_dependents >= 3 → 5% tax
    - Else → 8% tax
  - Else → 10% tax
- Elif income <= $85,000:
  - If has_dependents:
    - If num_dependents >= 3 → 12% tax
    - Else → 15% tax
  - Else → 18% tax
- Else (income > $85,000):
  - If has_dependents:
    - If num_dependents >= 3 → 20% tax
    - Else → 24% tax
  - Else → 28% tax

Calculate tax amount.

Test with income = 50000, has_dependents = True, num_dependents = 2.

**Expected Output:**
```
Tax: $7500.00 (15%)
```

**Hint:** Nested structure for income brackets, then dependent status, then number of dependents.
