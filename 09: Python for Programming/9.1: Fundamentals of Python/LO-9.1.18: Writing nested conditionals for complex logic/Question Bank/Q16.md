### **16. Shipping Cost Calculator**

Calculate shipping cost based on:
- Weight tiers with base costs
- Destination zones (domestic/international)
- Express shipping option

Rules:
- If weight <= 5kg:
  - If domestic:
    - If express → $15
    - Else → $8
  - Else (international):
    - If express → $30
    - Else → $20
- Elif weight <= 20kg:
  - If domestic:
    - If express → $25
    - Else → $15
  - Else:
    - If express → $50
    - Else → $35
- Else:
  - If domestic:
    - If express → $40
    - Else → $25
  - Else:
    - If express → $80
    - Else → $50

Test with weight = 3, is_domestic = True, is_express = False.

**Expected Output:**
```
Shipping cost: $8
```

**Hint:** Three-level nesting: weight tier, then destination, then shipping speed.
