## Problem 27: Sum of Squares

**Problem:** Calculate sum of squares from 1 to 10.

**Solution:**
```python
def sum_of_squares():
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, 11):
        total += i ** 2

    print(f"Sum of squares from 1 to 10: {total}")

sum_of_squares()
```

**Output:**
```
Sum of squares from 1 to 10: 385
```

**Explanation:**
- 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + 10²
- 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100 = 385
- Formula: n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 = 10(11)(21)/6 = 385

**Key Concept:** Functions compute mathematical series.
