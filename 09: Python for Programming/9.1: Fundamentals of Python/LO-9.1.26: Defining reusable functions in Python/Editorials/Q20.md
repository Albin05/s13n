## Problem 20: Leap Year Checker

**Problem:** Check if 2024 is a leap year.

**Solution:**
```python
def is_leap_year():
    year = 2024

    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
        print(f"{year} is a leap year")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is not a leap year")

is_leap_year()
```

**Output:**
```
2024 is a leap year
```

**Explanation:**
- Leap year rules:
  1. Divisible by 4: 2024 % 4 == 0 ✓
  2. NOT divisible by 100 OR divisible by 400
  3. 2024 % 100 = 24 (not 0), so condition 1 is met
- Therefore 2024 is a leap year
- Complex logic encapsulated in function

**Key Concept:** Functions handle complex conditional logic.
