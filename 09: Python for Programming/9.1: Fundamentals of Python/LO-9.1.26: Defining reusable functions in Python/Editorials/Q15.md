## Problem 15: Grade Calculator

**Problem:** Determine letter grade for score 85.

**Solution:**
```python
def calculate_grade():
    score = 85

    if score >= 90:
        grade = 'A'
    elif score >= 80:
        grade = 'B'
    elif score >= 70:
        grade = 'C'
    elif score >= 60:
        grade = 'D'
    else:
        grade = 'F'

    print(f"Score {score} is grade: {grade}")

calculate_grade()
```

**Output:**
```
Score 85 is grade: B
```

**Explanation:**
- 85 is not >= 90, so not A
- 85 is >= 80, so grade is B
- elif chain stops at first True condition
- Function encapsulates grading logic

**Key Concept:** Functions handle conditional logic and decision-making.
