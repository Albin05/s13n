## Problem 9: Fibonacci Sequence

**Problem:** Create a function that prints first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

**Solution:**
```python
def print_fibonacci():
    a, b = 0, 1
    count = 0

    while count < 10:
        print(a, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a + b
        count += 1

print_fibonacci()
```

**Output:**
```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

**Explanation:**
- Start with a=0, b=1
- Print a, then update: a becomes b, b becomes a+b
- Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
- Each number is sum of previous two
- Multiple assignment `a, b = b, a + b` swaps efficiently

**Key Concept:** Functions can generate sequences and patterns.
