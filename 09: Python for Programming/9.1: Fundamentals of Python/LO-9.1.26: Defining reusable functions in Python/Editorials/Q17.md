## Problem 17: Factorial Calculator

**Problem:** Calculate factorial of 5.

**Solution:**
```python
def factorial():
    n = 5
    result = 1

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i

    print(f"{n}! = {result}")

factorial()
```

**Output:**
```
5! = 120
```

**Explanation:**
- 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
- Start with result = 1
- Multiply by each number from 1 to 5
- result becomes: 1 → 1 → 2 → 6 → 24 → 120

**Key Concept:** Functions implement mathematical operations.
