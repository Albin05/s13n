## Problem 11: Even Number Counter

**Problem:** Count even numbers in range 1 to 20.

**Solution:**
```python
def count_evens():
    count = 0
    for num in range(1, 21):
        if num % 2 == 0:
            count += 1
    print(f"Count of even numbers: {count}")

count_evens()
```

**Output:**
```
Count of even numbers: 10
```

**Explanation:**
- Range 1-20 contains: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
- That's 10 even numbers
- Counter increments when `num % 2 == 0`

**Key Concept:** Functions can accumulate and report statistics.
