## Problem 18: Common Elements Finder

**Problem:** Find common elements between two lists.

**Solution:**
```python
def find_common():
    list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    common = []

    for item in list1:
        if item in list2:
            common.append(item)

    print(f"Common elements: {common}")

find_common()
```

**Output:**
```
Common elements: [4, 5]
```

**Explanation:**
- Check each element of list1 against list2
- 4 is in both lists → add to common
- 5 is in both lists → add to common
- Result: [4, 5]
- Alternative: `list(set(list1) & set(list2))`

**Key Concept:** Functions can find relationships between data sets.
