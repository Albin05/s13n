## Problem 21: Vowel Counter

**Problem:** Count vowels in "Education".

**Solution:**
```python
def count_vowels():
    word = "Education"
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0

    for char in word:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1

    print(f"Number of vowels: {count}")

count_vowels()
```

**Output:**
```
Number of vowels: 5
```

**Explanation:**
- "Education" contains: E, u, a, i, o
- That's 5 vowels
- Loop checks each character
- Case-insensitive by including both cases in vowels string

**Key Concept:** Functions process text and count patterns.
