## Problem 26: Palindrome Checker

**Problem:** Check if "madam" is a palindrome.

**Solution:**
```python
def is_palindrome():
    word = "madam"
    reversed_word = word[::-1]

    if word == reversed_word:
        print(f'"{word}" is a palindrome')
    else:
        print(f'"{word}" is not a palindrome')

is_palindrome()
```

**Output:**
```
"madam" is a palindrome
```

**Explanation:**
- "madam" reversed is "madam"
- They're equal, so it's a palindrome
- Works for any word or phrase
- Case-sensitive version shown

**Key Concept:** Functions validate text properties.
