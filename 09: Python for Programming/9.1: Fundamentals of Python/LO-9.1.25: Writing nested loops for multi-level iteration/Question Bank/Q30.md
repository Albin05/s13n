### **30. Nested List Comprehension Alternative**

Create same 3x3 matrix using nested loops (not comprehension).

**Expected Output:**
```python
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]
```

**Hint:** Track counter across nested loops, append to row, row to matrix.

## Key Concepts

### Basic Structure

```python
# Simple nested loop
for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(cols):
        # Inner loop body
```

### Common Patterns

1. **Rectangular Grid:**
   ```python
   for row in range(rows):
       for col in range(cols):
           print('*', end=' ')
       print()  # New line
   ```

2. **Triangle Pattern:**
   ```python
   for row in range(n):
       for col in range(row + 1):
           print('*', end=' ')
       print()
   ```

3. **2D List Processing:**
   ```python
   for row in matrix:
       for element in row:
           process(element)
   ```

4. **With Indices:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(matrix)):
       for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
           print(matrix[i][j])
   ```

### Performance Considerations

- **Time Complexity:** Nested loops multiply complexity
  - One loop: O(n)
  - Two nested: O(n²)
  - Three nested: O(n³)

- **When to Use:**
  - Multi-dimensional data (matrices, grids)
  - Combinatorial problems (all pairs, combinations)
  - Pattern printing
  - Searching in 2D structures

- **When to Avoid:**
  - If same result possible with single loop
  - Very large datasets (consider alternatives)
  - Deep nesting (> 3 levels gets complex)

### Control Flow

```python
# Break from nested loops
found = False
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if condition:
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        break

# Continue in nested loops
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if skip_condition:
            continue  # Skips to next j
        process(i, j)
```

### Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong Range:** Using same range for both loops when they should differ
2. **Index Errors:** Accessing matrix[j][i] instead of matrix[i][j]
3. **Missing New Line:** Forgetting print() after inner loop
4. **Infinite Loops:** Not updating loop variables correctly
5. **Breaking Outer Loop:** Forgetting to check flag after inner loop

### Best Practices

1. **Clear Variable Names:** Use `row, col` instead of `i, j` for clarity
2. **Comments:** Explain what each loop level represents
3. **Keep It Simple:** Limit nesting depth to 2-3 levels
4. **Extract Functions:** Move complex inner logic to functions
5. **Test Edge Cases:** Empty lists, single element, etc.

### Real-World Applications

1. **Image Processing:** Iterate through pixels (rows × columns)
2. **Game Boards:** Chess, tic-tac-toe, etc.
3. **Spreadsheets:** Process cells in tables
4. **Data Analysis:** Multi-dimensional data structures
5. **Graph Algorithms:** Adjacency matrices
6. **Scientific Computing:** Matrix operations
7. **Pattern Generation:** ASCII art, designs
8. **Combinatorics:** Generate all combinations/permutations

### Practice Tips

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with basic rectangles, then triangles
2. **Visualize:** Draw what you want before coding
3. **Trace Execution:** Manually follow loop iterations
4. **Use Print:** Debug by printing i, j values
5. **Build Incrementally:** Start with outer loop, add inner loop
6. **Test Patterns:** Use small values (3x3) before scaling up
7. **Understand Indices:** Know what each loop variable represents
8. **Practice Variations:** Same pattern in different ways

## Additional Challenges

### Challenge 1: Hourglass Pattern
Print an hourglass shape.

### Challenge 2: Zigzag Pattern
Create a zigzag pattern across rows.

### Challenge 3: Rotating Matrix
Rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

### Challenge 4: Finding Saddle Point
Find element that is max in row and min in column.

### Challenge 5: Generating Fibonacci Matrix
Each element is sum of element above and to the left.

## Summary

Nested loops are essential for:
- Working with multi-dimensional data
- Creating patterns and shapes
- Processing grids and matrices
- Generating combinations
- Implementing complex algorithms

Master nested loops by:
1. Understanding loop execution order
2. Tracking multiple indices correctly
3. Visualizing the output structure
4. Managing control flow (break/continue)
5. Considering performance implications

Remember: The outer loop runs completely before inner loop, and inner loop completes fully for each outer loop iteration!
