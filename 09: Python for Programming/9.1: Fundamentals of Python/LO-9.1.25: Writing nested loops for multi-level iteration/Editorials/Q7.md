## Problem 7: Sum of 2D List

**Problem:** Calculate sum of all elements in a 2D list.

**Solution:**
```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9]]

total = 0

for row in matrix:
    for element in row:
        total += element

print(f"Sum: {total}")
```

**Output:**
```
Sum: 45
```

**Explanation:**
- Initialize total to 0
- Outer loop: iterate through each row
- Inner loop: iterate through elements in that row
- Add each element to total
- Sum: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45

**Key Concept:** Process all elements in 2D structure with nested loops.
