## Problem 10: Find Maximum (Hard)

### Solution
```python
numbers = [45, 12, 78, 34, 90, 23]
max_num = numbers[0]  # Initialize with first element

for num in numbers:
    if num > max_num:
        max_num = num

print(f"Maximum: {max_num}")
```

**Output:**
```
Maximum: 90
```

### Explanation
- Initialize max with first element
- Compare each number to current max
- Update max when larger found
- Final max is 90
- Alternative: use built-in `max(numbers)`
- Understanding algorithm is important
