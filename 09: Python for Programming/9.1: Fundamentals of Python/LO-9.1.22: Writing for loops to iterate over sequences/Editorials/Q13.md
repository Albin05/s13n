## Problem 13: Reverse Iteration (Hard)

### Solution
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in reversed(numbers):
    print(num)
```

**Output:**
```
5
4
3
2
1
```

### Explanation
- `reversed()` iterates in reverse order
- Original list unchanged
- Returns reverse iterator
- More efficient than `numbers[::-1]` for large lists
- Works with any sequence
