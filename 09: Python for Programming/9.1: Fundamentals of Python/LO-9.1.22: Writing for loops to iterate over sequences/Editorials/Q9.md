## Problem 9: Nested Lists (Hard)

### Solution
```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

for row in matrix:
    for num in row:
        print(num, end=" ")
    print()  # Newline after each row
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

### Explanation
- Outer loop iterates rows
- Inner loop iterates elements in each row
- `end=" "` prints on same line
- `print()` after inner loop creates newline
- Nested for loops for 2D structures
