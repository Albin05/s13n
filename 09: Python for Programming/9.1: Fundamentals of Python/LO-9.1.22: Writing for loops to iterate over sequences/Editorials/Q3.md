## Problem 3: Iterate String Characters (Easy)

### Solution
```python
word = "python"

for char in word:
    print(char)
```

**Output:**
```
p
y
t
h
o
n
```

### Explanation
- Strings are sequences - can iterate directly
- Each character accessed in order
- Variable `char` holds each character
- No need for `word[i]` indexing
- More readable than while loop
