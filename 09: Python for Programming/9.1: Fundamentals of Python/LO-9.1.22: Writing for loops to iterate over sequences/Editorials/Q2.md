## Problem 2: Sum List Numbers (Easy)

### Solution
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total = 0

for num in numbers:
    total += num

print(f"Total: {total}")
```

**Output:**
```
Total: 150
```

### Explanation
- Initialize total before loop
- Each iteration adds current number to total
- 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 150
- Accumulator pattern with for loop
- Simpler than while loop (no manual indexing)
