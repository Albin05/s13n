## Problem 15: Nested Dictionary (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
school = {
    "math": {"Alice": 90, "Bob": 85},
    "science": {"Alice": 88, "Bob": 92}
}

for subject, students in school.items():
    print(f"\n{subject.upper()}:")
    for student, grade in students.items():
        print(f"  {student}: {grade}")
```

**Output:**
```
MATH:
  Alice: 90
  Bob: 85

SCIENCE:
  Alice: 88
  Bob: 92
```

### Explanation
- Nested dictionary structure
- Outer loop: subjects
- Inner loop: students in each subject
- Two-level unpacking
- Demonstrates complex data iteration
