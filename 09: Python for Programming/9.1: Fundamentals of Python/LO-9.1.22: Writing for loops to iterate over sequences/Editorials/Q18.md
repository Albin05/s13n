## Problem 18: Count Word Frequencies (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
text = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the fox"
words = text.split()
frequency = {}

for word in words:
    if word in frequency:
        frequency[word] += 1
    else:
        frequency[word] = 1

for word, count in frequency.items():
    print(f"{word}: {count}")
```

**Output:**
```
the: 3
quick: 1
brown: 1
fox: 2
jumps: 1
over: 1
lazy: 1
dog: 1
```

### Explanation
- Count occurrences of each word
- First loop: build frequency dictionary
- Check if word exists, increment or initialize
- Second loop: display results
- Classic frequency counting pattern
