## Problem 11: List Comprehension Alternative (Hard)

### Solution
```python
# Traditional for loop
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = []

for num in numbers:
    squares.append(num ** 2)

print(f"Squares: {squares}")

# List comprehension (more Pythonic)
squares_comp = [num ** 2 for num in numbers]
print(f"Squares (comprehension): {squares_comp}")
```

**Output:**
```
Squares: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Squares (comprehension): [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### Explanation
- Both produce same result
- List comprehension is more concise
- Syntax: `[expression for item in sequence]`
- For loop more readable for beginners
- Comprehension faster for large lists
