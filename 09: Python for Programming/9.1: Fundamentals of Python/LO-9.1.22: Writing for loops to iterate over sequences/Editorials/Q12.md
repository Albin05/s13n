## Problem 12: Tuple Unpacking (Hard)

### Solution
```python
students = [
    ("Alice", 85),
    ("Bob", 92),
    ("Charlie", 78)
]

for name, score in students:
    print(f"{name} scored {score}")
```

**Output:**
```
Alice scored 85
Bob scored 92
Charlie scored 78
```

### Explanation
- List contains tuples
- For loop unpacks each tuple
- `name, score` gets values from tuple
- Works with any iterable of tuples
- Clean way to handle structured data
