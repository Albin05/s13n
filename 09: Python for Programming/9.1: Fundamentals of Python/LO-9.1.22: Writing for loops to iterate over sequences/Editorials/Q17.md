## Problem 17: Flatten Nested List (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
nested = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]
flat = []

for sublist in nested:
    for num in sublist:
        flat.append(num)

print(f"Flattened: {flat}")
```

**Output:**
```
Flattened: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

### Explanation
- Convert 2D list to 1D
- Outer loop: each sublist
- Inner loop: elements in sublist
- Append all to single flat list
- Result contains all 9 numbers in order
