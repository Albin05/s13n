### **20. Student Grades Average**

Calculate average grade for each student from a dictionary of lists.

Given grades:
```python
grades = {
    "Alice": [85, 90, 88],
    "Bob": [92, 87, 95],
    "Charlie": [78, 82, 80]
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice: 87.7
Bob: 91.3
Charlie: 80.0
```

**Hint:** Iterate dictionary items, calculate sum/len for each student's list.
