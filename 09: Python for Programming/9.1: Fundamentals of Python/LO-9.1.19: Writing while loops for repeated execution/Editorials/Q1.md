## Problem 1: Count to 10 (Easy)

### Solution
```python
count = 1

while count <= 10:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

### Explanation
- Initialize `count = 1` before loop
- Loop continues while `count <= 10`
- Print current count
- **CRITICAL**: Increment `count += 1` to eventually make condition False
- Without increment, loop would run forever (infinite loop)
- Loop stops when count becomes 11 (condition False)
