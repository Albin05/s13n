## Problem 4: Password Validator (Medium)

### Solution
```python
correct_password = "python123"
attempts = 0
max_attempts = 3

password = input("Enter password: ")
attempts += 1

while password != correct_password and attempts < max_attempts:
    print("Incorrect password")
    password = input("Enter password: ")
    attempts += 1

if password == correct_password:
    print("Access granted")
else:
    print("Too many failed attempts")
```

**Example Output (successful):**
```
Enter password: wrong
Incorrect password
Enter password: python123
Access granted
```

### Explanation
- First attempt before loop
- Loop continues if: password wrong AND attempts remain
- Tracks number of attempts
- After loop, check WHY it stopped:
  - Password correct → Access granted
  - Too many attempts → Locked out
- Prevents brute force attacks with attempt limit
