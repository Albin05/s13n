## Problem 6: Guess the Number (Medium)

### Solution
```python
secret_number = 42
guess = int(input("Guess the number: "))

while guess != secret_number:
    if guess < secret_number:
        print("Too low!")
    else:
        print("Too high!")
    guess = int(input("Guess again: "))

print("Correct! You guessed it!")
```

**Example Interaction:**
```
Guess the number: 50
Too high!
Guess again: 30
Too low!
Guess again: 42
Correct! You guessed it!
```

### Explanation
- Loop until guess matches secret
- Provide feedback (too high/low) each iteration
- Update guess inside loop
- Classic game pattern
- Could enhance with attempt counter
