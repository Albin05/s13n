## Problem 14: GCD Calculator (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
a = 48
b = 18

while b != 0:
    temp = b
    b = a % b
    a = temp

print(f"GCD: {a}")
```

**Output:**
```
GCD: 6
```

### Explanation
- Euclidean algorithm for GCD
- Iteration trace:
  - a=48, b=18: b becomes 48%18=12, a becomes 18
  - a=18, b=12: b becomes 18%12=6, a becomes 12
  - a=12, b=6: b becomes 12%6=0, a becomes 6
  - b=0: loop stops, a=6 is GCD
- Efficient algorithm (logarithmic time)
- Classic use of while loop
