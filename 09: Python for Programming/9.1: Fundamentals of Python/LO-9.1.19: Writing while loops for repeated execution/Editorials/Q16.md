## Problem 16: Collatz Sequence (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
n = 10
steps = 0

print(f"Starting with {n}:")
while n != 1:
    print(n, end=" → ")
    if n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2
    else:
        n = 3 * n + 1
    steps += 1

print(f"1\nReached 1 in {steps} steps")
```

**Output:**
```
Starting with 10:
10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
Reached 1 in 6 steps
```

### Explanation
- Collatz conjecture: any number eventually reaches 1
- Rule: if even divide by 2, if odd multiply by 3 and add 1
- Sequence for 10: 10→5→16→8→4→2→1
- Track number of steps
- Famous unsolved problem in mathematics
- Demonstrates conditional logic in loops
