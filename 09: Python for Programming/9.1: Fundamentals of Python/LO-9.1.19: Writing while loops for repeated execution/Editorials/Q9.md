## Problem 9: Fibonacci Sequence (Hard)

### Solution
```python
n = 10
a, b = 0, 1
count = 0

print("First 10 Fibonacci numbers:")
while count < n:
    print(a, end=" ")
    a, b = b, a + b
    count += 1

print()
```

**Output:**
```
First 10 Fibonacci numbers:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

### Explanation
- Generate first n Fibonacci numbers
- Pattern: each number is sum of previous two
- `a, b = b, a + b` is simultaneous assignment:
  - New a = old b
  - New b = old a + old b
- Elegant way to update two variables
- Counter tracks how many generated
