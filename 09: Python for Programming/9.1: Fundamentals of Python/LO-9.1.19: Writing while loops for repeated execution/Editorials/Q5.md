## Problem 5: Find First Multiple of 7 (Medium)

### Solution
```python
number = 1

while number % 7 != 0:
    number += 1

print(f"First multiple of 7: {number}")
```

**Output:**
```
First multiple of 7: 7
```

### Explanation
- Start at 1, increment until divisible by 7
- Condition: `number % 7 != 0` (not a multiple)
- Loop stops when `number % 7 == 0` (is a multiple)
- In this case, stops at 7
- Pattern: loop until condition is met
- Could modify to find nth multiple by adding counter
