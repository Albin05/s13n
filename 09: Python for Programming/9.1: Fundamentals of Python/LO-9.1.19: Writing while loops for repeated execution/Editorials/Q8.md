## Problem 8: Factorial Calculator (Hard)

### Solution
```python
n = 5
factorial = 1
i = 1

while i <= n:
    factorial *= i
    i += 1

print(f"{n}! = {factorial}")
```

**Output:**
```
5! = 120
```

### Explanation
- Calculate 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
- Initialize factorial = 1 (multiplicative identity)
- Multiply by each number from 1 to n
- Increment counter each iteration
- Alternative to for loop
- Pattern: accumulator with multiplication
