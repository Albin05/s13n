## Problem 18: Power Calculator Without ** (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
base = 2
exponent = 5
result = 1
counter = 0

while counter < exponent:
    result *= base
    counter += 1

print(f"{base}^{exponent} = {result}")
```

**Output:**
```
2^5 = 32
```

### Explanation
- Calculate 2⁵ = 2×2×2×2×2 = 32
- Multiply base by itself exponent times
- Initialize result = 1 (multiplicative identity)
- Loop exponent times
- Alternative to using ** operator
- Demonstrates loop-based accumulation
