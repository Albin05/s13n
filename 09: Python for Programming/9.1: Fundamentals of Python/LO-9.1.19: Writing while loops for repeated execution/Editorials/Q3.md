## Problem 3: Sum Numbers Until 0 (Easy)

### Solution
```python
total = 0
number = int(input("Enter a number (0 to stop): "))

while number != 0:
    total += number
    number = int(input("Enter a number (0 to stop): "))

print(f"Total: {total}")
```

**Example Interaction:**
```
Enter a number (0 to stop): 10
Enter a number (0 to stop): 20
Enter a number (0 to stop): 15
Enter a number (0 to stop): 0
Total: 45
```

### Explanation
- Read first number before loop (priming read)
- Loop continues until user enters 0
- Add each number to total
- Read next number at end of loop
- Sentinel value (0) controls loop termination
- Final print happens after loop exits
