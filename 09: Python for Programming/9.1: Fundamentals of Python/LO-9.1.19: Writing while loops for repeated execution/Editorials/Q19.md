## Problem 19: String Character Counter (Hard)

### Solution
```python
text = "hello world"
char_to_count = "l"
index = 0
count = 0

while index < len(text):
    if text[index] == char_to_count:
        count += 1
    index += 1

print(f"'{char_to_count}' appears {count} times")
```

**Output:**
```
'l' appears 3 times
```

### Explanation
- Count occurrences of character in string
- Use index to access each character
- Increment index each iteration
- Increment count when character matches
- Loop while index < string length
- Alternative to for loop with strings
