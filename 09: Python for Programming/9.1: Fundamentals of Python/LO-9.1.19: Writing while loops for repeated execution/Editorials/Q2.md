## Problem 2: Countdown from 5 (Easy)

### Solution
```python
countdown = 5

while countdown > 0:
    print(countdown)
    countdown -= 1

print("Blast off!")
```

**Output:**
```
5
4
3
2
1
Blast off!
```

### Explanation
- Start at 5, decrement each iteration
- Condition `countdown > 0` means loop stops when countdown reaches 0
- `countdown -= 1` decreases value by 1 each time
- After loop exits, print "Blast off!"
- Common pattern for countdowns and timers
