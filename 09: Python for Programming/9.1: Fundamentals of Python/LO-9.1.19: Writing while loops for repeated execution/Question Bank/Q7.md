### **7. Double Until Exceeds 1000**

Start with value = 1. Keep doubling it until it exceeds 1000. Print each value and count iterations.

**Expected Output:**
```
Iteration 0: 1
Iteration 1: 2
Iteration 2: 4
Iteration 3: 8
Iteration 4: 16
Iteration 5: 32
Iteration 6: 64
Iteration 7: 128
Iteration 8: 256
Iteration 9: 512
Final value: 1024
Total iterations: 10
```

**Hint:** Loop while value <= 1000, multiply value by 2 each time, track iterations.
