### **3. Sum Numbers Until 0**

Write a program that keeps asking for numbers and sums them. Stop when user enters 0.

**Example Interaction:**
```
Enter a number (0 to stop): 10
Enter a number (0 to stop): 20
Enter a number (0 to stop): 15
Enter a number (0 to stop): 0
Total: 45
```

**Hint:** Use sentinel value 0. Priming read before loop, read again at end of loop.
