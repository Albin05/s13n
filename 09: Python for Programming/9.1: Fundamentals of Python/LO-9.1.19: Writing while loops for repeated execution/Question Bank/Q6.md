### **6. Guess the Number**

Create a number guessing game. Secret number is 42. Keep asking until user guesses correctly, providing "Too high" or "Too low" hints.

**Example Interaction:**
```
Guess the number: 50
Too high!
Guess again: 30
Too low!
Guess again: 42
Correct! You guessed it!
```

**Hint:** Loop while guess != secret, provide feedback inside loop.
