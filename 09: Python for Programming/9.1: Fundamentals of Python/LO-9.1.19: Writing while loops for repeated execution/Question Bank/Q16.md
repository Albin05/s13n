### **16. Collatz Sequence**

Starting with 10, apply Collatz rules until reaching 1:
- If even: divide by 2
- If odd: multiply by 3 and add 1

Print the sequence and count steps.

**Expected Output:**
```
Starting with 10:
10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
Reached 1 in 6 steps
```

**Hint:** Loop while n != 1, apply rule based on n % 2.
