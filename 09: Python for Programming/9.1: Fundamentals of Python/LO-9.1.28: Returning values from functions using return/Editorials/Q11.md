## Problem 11: Return from Loop

**Problem:** Create a function `find_first_even` that takes a list and returns the first even number found.

**Solution:**
```python
def find_first_even(numbers):
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            return num  # Exit immediately when found
    return None  # If no even number found

# Test case
nums = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10]
result = find_first_even(nums)
print(result)  # 8
```

**Output:**
```
8
```

**Explanation:**
- Function loops through list
- When first even number is found, immediately returns it
- `return` inside loop exits the entire function
- Sequence: checks 1 (odd), 3 (odd), 5 (odd), 8 (even) → returns 8
- 9 and 10 are never checked (function already exited)
- If no even number found, loop completes and returns None
- This is called "early return" - exits as soon as answer is found

**Key Concept:** `return` inside a loop exits the function immediately, stopping iteration.
