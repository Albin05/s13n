## Problem 1: Simple Return

**Problem:** Write a function `double` that takes a number and returns double its value.

**Solution:**
```python
def double(number):
    return number * 2

# Test cases
result = double(5)
print(result)  # 10

result = double(12)
print(result)  # 24
```

**Output:**
```
10
24
```

**Explanation:**
- The function takes one parameter `number`
- It calculates `number * 2` and returns the result
- The `return` statement sends the value back to the caller
- First call: `double(5)` returns 10, which is stored in `result` and printed
- Second call: `double(12)` returns 24
- The returned value can be stored in a variable for later use

**Key Concept:** `return` sends data back from the function to wherever it was called.
