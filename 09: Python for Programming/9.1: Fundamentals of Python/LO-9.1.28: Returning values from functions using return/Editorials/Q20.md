## Problem 20: Return Factorial

**Problem:** Create a function `factorial` that takes a number and returns its factorial.

**Solution:**
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1

    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Test cases
print(factorial(5))  # 120
print(factorial(3))  # 6
print(factorial(0))  # 1
```

**Output:**
```
120
6
1
```

**Explanation:**
- Factorial: n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1
- Special case: 0! = 1 and 1! = 1
- 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
- 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6
- Uses loop to multiply numbers from 2 to n
- Returns accumulated product
- Could also use recursion

**Key Concept:** Mathematical operations often need to return calculated values.
