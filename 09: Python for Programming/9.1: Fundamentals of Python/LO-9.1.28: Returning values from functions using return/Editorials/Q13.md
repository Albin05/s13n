## Problem 13: Calculate Discount with Return

**Problem:** Define a function `apply_discount` that takes price and discount percentage, returns final price.

**Solution:**
```python
def apply_discount(price, discount_percent):
    discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)
    final_price = price - discount_amount
    return final_price

# Test cases
final = apply_discount(100, 20)
print(f"${final}")  # $80.0

final = apply_discount(250, 10)
print(f"${final}")  # $225.0
```

**Output:**
```
$80.0
$225.0
```

**Explanation:**
- Calculates discount amount from percentage
- Subtracts discount from original price
- Returns final price
- First: $100 with 20% off → $100 - $20 = $80
- Second: $250 with 10% off → $250 - $25 = $225
- Could be simplified to one line:
  ```python
  return price * (1 - discount_percent / 100)
  ```
- Returned value can be used in more calculations (e.g., adding tax)

**Key Concept:** Return intermediate results for use in multi-step calculations.
