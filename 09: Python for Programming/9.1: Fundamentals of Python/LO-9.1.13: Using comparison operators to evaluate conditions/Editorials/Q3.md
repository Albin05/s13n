## Problem 3
```python
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

failed = score < 60
passed = score >= 60
excellent = score >= 90

print(f"Failed: {failed}")
print(f"Passed: {passed}")
print(f"Excellent: {excellent}")
```

### Explanation

- Create three boolean variables:
  - `failed`: score less than 60
  - `passed`: score 60 or higher
  - `excellent`: score 90 or higher
- Print all three results
