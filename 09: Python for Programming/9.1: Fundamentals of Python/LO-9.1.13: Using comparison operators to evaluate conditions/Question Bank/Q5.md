### **5. Write a program that:**

1. Takes temperature in Celsius
2. Checks multiple conditions:
   - Is freezing (<= 0)
   - Is cold (< 15)
   - Is comfortable (>= 15 and <= 25)
   - Is hot (> 25)
   - Is very hot (>= 35)
3. Store each result in a variable
4. Print all results

Example:
```
Enter temperature in Celsius: 30
Freezing: False
Cold: False
Comfortable: False
Hot: True
Very hot: False
```

Hint: You can use comparison operators to create each boolean variable!
