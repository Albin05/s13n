# Question Bank: Use Comparison Operators

## Problem 1 (Easy)
Write a program that:
1. Takes a user's age as input
2. Checks if they are 18 or older
3. Prints whether they can vote

Example:
```
Enter your age: 20
Can vote: True
```

## Problem 2 (Easy)
Write a program that compares two numbers and prints the results of all six comparison operators.

Example:
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 20

10 == 20: False
10 != 20: True
10 > 20: False
10 < 20: True
10 >= 20: False
10 <= 20: True
```

## Problem 3 (Medium)
Write a program that:
1. Takes a test score as input (0-100)
2. Determines if the student:
   - Failed (< 60)
   - Passed (>= 60)
   - Got excellent (>= 90)
3. Prints all three results

Example:
```
Enter your score: 85
Failed: False
Passed: True
Excellent: False
```

## Problem 4 (Medium)
Write a password strength checker that:
1. Takes a password as input
2. Checks if length >= 8 characters
3. Checks if length >= 12 characters
4. Prints both results

Example:
```
Enter password: mypass123
Minimum strength (8+ chars): True
Strong (12+ chars): False
```

## Problem 5 (Hard)
Write a program that:
1. Takes temperature in Celsius
2. Checks multiple conditions:
   - Is freezing (<= 0)
   - Is cold (< 15)
   - Is comfortable (>= 15 and <= 25)
   - Is hot (> 25)
   - Is very hot (>= 35)
3. Store each result in a variable
4. Print all results

Example:
```
Enter temperature in Celsius: 30
Freezing: False
Cold: False
Comfortable: False
Hot: True
Very hot: False
```

Hint: You can use comparison operators to create each boolean variable!
