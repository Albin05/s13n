### **4. Write a program that checks exam eligibility:**

1. Take attendance percentage and fee status (paid/unpaid)
2. If attendance >= 75 AND fee is paid, print "Eligible for exam"
3. If attendance < 75, print "Low attendance"
4. If fee is unpaid, print "Fee not paid"

Example:
```
Enter attendance %: 80
Fee paid? (paid/unpaid): paid
Eligible for exam
```
