### **5. Write a comprehensive grade calculator:**

1. Take a score (0-100) as input
2. Use multiple if statements to:
   - Check if score >= 90: print "Grade: A" and "Excellent work!"
   - Check if score >= 80 and < 90: print "Grade: B" and "Good job!"
   - Check if score >= 70 and < 80: print "Grade: C" and "Satisfactory"
   - Check if score >= 60 and < 70: print "Grade: D" and "Needs improvement"
   - Check if score < 60: print "Grade: F" and "Failed"
3. Also check:
   - If score == 100: print "Perfect score!"
   - If score < 50: print "Please see instructor"

Example:
```
Enter your score: 95
Grade: A
Excellent work!
```

Hint: You'll need multiple if statements with different conditions!
