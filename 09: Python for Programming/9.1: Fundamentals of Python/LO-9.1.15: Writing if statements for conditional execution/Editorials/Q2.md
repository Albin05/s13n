## Problem 2
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote")

if age >= 21:
    print("You can drink alcohol (in US)")

print("Thank you")
```

### Explanation
- Get age as integer
- First if checks 18+
- Second if checks 21+
- Last print always runs (not indented under any if)
- If age is 25, both if statements will execute
