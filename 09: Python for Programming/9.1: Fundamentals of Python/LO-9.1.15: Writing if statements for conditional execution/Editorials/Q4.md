## Problem 4
```python
attendance = float(input("Enter attendance %: "))
fee_status = input("Fee paid? (paid/unpaid): ").lower()

fee_paid = fee_status == "paid"

if attendance >= 75 and fee_paid:
    print("Eligible for exam")

if attendance < 75:
    print("Low attendance")

if not fee_paid:
    print("Fee not paid")
```

### Explanation
- Get attendance as float and fee status as string
- Convert fee status to boolean for easier checking
- First if requires BOTH conditions (using `and`)
- Second and third if statements check individual conditions
- All three if statements are independent
