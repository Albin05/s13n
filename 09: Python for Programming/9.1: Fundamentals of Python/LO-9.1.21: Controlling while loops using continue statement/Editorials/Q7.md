## Problem 7: Skip Based on Condition (Medium)

### Solution
```python
i = 0

while i < 20:
    i += 1
    if i > 10 and i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
13
15
17
19
```

### Explanation
- Print 1-20, but skip even numbers greater than 10
- Increment at start to avoid missing values
- Condition: i > 10 AND i is even → continue
- Skips: 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
- Prints all numbers 1-10, then only odds 11-19
- Complex filtering with compound condition
