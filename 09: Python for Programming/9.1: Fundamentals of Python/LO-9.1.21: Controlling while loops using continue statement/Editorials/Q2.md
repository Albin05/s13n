## Problem 2: Print Only Positives (Easy)

### Solution
```python
numbers = [5, -3, 8, -1, 12, -7, 4]

for num in numbers:
    if num < 0:
        continue
    print(num)
```

**Output:**
```
5
8
12
4
```

### Explanation
- Iterate through list
- If number is negative, `continue` (skip to next iteration)
- Print statement only reached for positive numbers
- `continue` acts as filter
- Cleaner than wrapping everything in else block
