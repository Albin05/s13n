## Problem 12: Skip Characters (Hard)

### Solution
```python
text = "h3ll0 w0rld!"
clean = ""

for char in text:
    if char.isdigit():
        continue
    clean += char

print(f"Cleaned text: {clean}")
```

**Output:**
```
Cleaned text: hll wrld!
```

### Explanation
- Remove all digits from string
- If character is digit, continue (don't add to result)
- Only non-digit characters accumulated
- Removed: 3, 0, 0
- String filtering pattern
- Alternative to regex for simple cases
