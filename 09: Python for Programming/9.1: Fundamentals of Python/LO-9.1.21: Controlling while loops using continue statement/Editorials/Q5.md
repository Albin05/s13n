## Problem 5: Count Non-Vowels (Medium)

### Solution
```python
text = "hello world"
consonant_count = 0

for char in text:
    if char in "aeiou ":
        continue
    consonant_count += 1

print(f"Consonants: {consonant_count}")
```

**Output:**
```
Consonants: 7
```

### Explanation
- Count consonants by skipping vowels and spaces
- If character is vowel or space, continue
- Only consonants increment counter
- Characters in text: h, l, l, r, w, l, d = 7 consonants
- Filter approach cleaner than complex condition
