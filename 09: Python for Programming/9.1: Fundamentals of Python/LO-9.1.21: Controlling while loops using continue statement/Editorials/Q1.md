## Problem 1: Skip Even Numbers (Easy)

### Solution
```python
count = 1

while count <= 10:
    if count % 2 == 0:
        count += 1
        continue
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

**Output:**
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

### Explanation
- Loop from 1 to 10
- When count is even (`count % 2 == 0`), increment and `continue`
- `continue` skips the print statement for even numbers
- Only odd numbers get printed
- **CRITICAL**: Must increment before continue, otherwise infinite loop
- Pattern: skip unwanted items
