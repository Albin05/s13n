## Problem 13: Conditional Processing (Very Hard)

### Solution
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = []

for num in numbers:
    # Skip odd numbers less than 5
    if num < 5 and num % 2 != 0:
        continue

    # Skip even numbers greater than 7
    if num > 7 and num % 2 == 0:
        continue

    result.append(num)

print(f"Filtered: {result}")
```

**Output:**
```
Filtered: [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]
```

### Explanation
- Two separate filter conditions
- First continue skips: 1, 3 (odd and < 5)
- Second continue skips: 8, 10 (even and > 7)
- Remaining numbers pass both filters
- Multiple continue statements possible
- Complex filtering logic
