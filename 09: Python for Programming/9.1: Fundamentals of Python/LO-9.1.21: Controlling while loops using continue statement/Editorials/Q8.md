## Problem 8: Process User Input (Hard)

### Solution
```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    command = input(f"Command {count + 1}: ")

    if command == "skip":
        print("Skipping this entry")
        continue

    print(f"Processing: {command}")
    count += 1

print("All commands processed")
```

**Example Output:**
```
Command 1: hello
Processing: hello
Command 2: skip
Skipping this entry
Command 2: world
Processing: world
Command 3: skip
Skipping this entry
Command 3: python
Processing: python
Command 4: code
Processing: code
Command 5: test
Processing: test
All commands processed
```

### Explanation
- Collect 5 valid commands
- "skip" doesn't count toward total
- `continue` prevents count increment for skipped items
- Loop repeats until 5 valid commands processed
- Validation pattern: retry without counting invalid
