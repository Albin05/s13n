### **23. Collect Valid Ages**

Keep asking for ages until user enters "done". Skip invalid ages (< 0 or > 120) without counting them.

**Example Interaction:**
```
Enter age (or 'done'): 25
Valid age added
Enter age (or 'done'): 150
Invalid age, skipped
Enter age (or 'done'): -5
Invalid age, skipped
Enter age (or 'done'): 30
Valid age added
Enter age (or 'done'): done

Valid ages collected: 2
Ages: [25, 30]
Average age: 27.5
```

**Hint:** while True with break on "done", continue on invalid age, collect valid ones.
