### **9. Process Valid Commands**

Keep asking for 5 commands. If user enters "skip", don't count it and ask again.

**Example Interaction:**
```
Command 1: hello
Command 2: skip
Command 2: world
Command 3: python
Command 4: skip
Command 4: code
Command 5: test
All commands collected!
```

**Hint:** Use while loop with counter. If command == "skip", continue (don't increment).
