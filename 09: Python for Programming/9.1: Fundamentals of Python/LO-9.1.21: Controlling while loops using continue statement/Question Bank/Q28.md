### **28. Two-Stage Filter**

From a list of strings, print only those that:
- Are longer than 3 characters
- Don't contain digits

Given: `["cat", "hello", "a1b", "world", "xy", "test123", "python"]`

**Expected Output:**
```
hello
world
python
```

**Hint:** First continue for length, second continue for digits check.

## Key Patterns to Practice

1. **Single filter**: Skip one type of unwanted item
2. **Multiple filters**: Several continue statements for complex filtering
3. **Data validation**: Skip invalid while processing valid
4. **Input retry**: Continue without counting on bad input
5. **Nested loops**: Continue affects innermost loop only
6. **Data cleaning**: Remove errors, outliers, empty values
7. **Range exclusion**: Skip values within a range
8. **Condition combination**: Skip based on multiple conditions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Forgetting to increment before continue in while loop (infinite loop)
2. Using continue when break is needed (want to exit, not skip)
3. Not understanding continue only affects current iteration
4. Placing increment after continue in while loop
5. Confusing which loop continue affects in nested loops
