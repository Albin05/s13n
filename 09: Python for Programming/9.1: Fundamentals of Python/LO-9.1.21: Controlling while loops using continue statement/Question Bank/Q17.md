### **17. Matrix Non-Zero Sum**

Calculate sum and average of all non-zero values in a 2D matrix.

Given matrix:
```python
matrix = [
    [1, 0, 3],
    [0, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 0]
]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Non-zero sum: 30
Non-zero count: 6
Average: 5.0
```

**Hint:** Nested loops, continue when value is 0, accumulate others.
