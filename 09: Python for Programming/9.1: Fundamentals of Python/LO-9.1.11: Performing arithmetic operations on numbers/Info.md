# LO-11: Perform Arithmetic Operations

## Learning Objective
Master all arithmetic operators and perform calculations in Python.

## Duration
15-20 minutes

## Key Concepts
1. **Basic operators**: +, -, *, /
2. **Integer division**: //
3. **Modulo**: %
4. **Exponentiation**: **
5. **Augmented assignment**: +=, -=, *=, /=

## Learning Outcomes
- [ ] Use all arithmetic operators correctly
- [ ] Understand operator behavior with different types
- [ ] Apply augmented assignment operators
- [ ] Solve real-world calculation problems

## Real-World Applications
- **Calculators**: Basic and scientific calculations
- **Finance**: Interest, tax, discounts
- **Gaming**: Score updates, damage calculations
- **Science**: Formula implementations

## Common Misconceptions
1. `/` always returns integer → No, always returns float
2. Can't chain operations → Yes, you can: `a + b * c`
3. `**` is for strings → No, it's exponentiation

## Success Criteria
- Perform calculations using all operators
- Choose correct operator for task
- Use augmented assignment efficiently
- Debug arithmetic expressions

## Next Steps
**LO-12**: Apply Operator Precedence
