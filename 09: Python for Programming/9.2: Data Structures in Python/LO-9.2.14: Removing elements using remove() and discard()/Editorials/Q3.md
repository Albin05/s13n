### Q3: Feature Flag Manager

**Solution:**

```python
# Critical features that cannot be disabled
CRITICAL = {'authentication', 'security'}

# Read initial features
n = int(input())
features = set(input().split())

# Process commands
while True:
    command = input().split()

    if command[0] == 'status':
        print(f"Active features: {' '.join(sorted(features))}")
        critical_intact = CRITICAL.issubset(features)
        if critical_intact:
            print(f"Critical features intact: {' '.join(sorted(CRITICAL))}")
        else:
            print(f"WARNING: Missing critical features!")
        break

    action = command[0]
    feature = command[1]

    if action == 'enable':
        before = len(features)
        features.add(feature)
        after = len(features)
        print(f"Enabled {feature} ({before} → {after} features)")

    elif action == 'disable':
        # Check if critical
        if feature in CRITICAL:
            print(f"Cannot disable critical feature: {feature}")
        else:
            before = len(features)
            features.discard(feature)
            after = len(features)
            print(f"Disabled {feature} ({before} → {after} features)")
```

**Explanation:**

1. Define CRITICAL features as a constant set
2. Check before disabling if feature is critical
3. Use discard() for safe removal (feature might not be enabled)
4. Track feature count before and after to show changes
5. Use issubset() to verify all critical features are present

**Key Learning:** Combine validation logic with safe removal methods.
