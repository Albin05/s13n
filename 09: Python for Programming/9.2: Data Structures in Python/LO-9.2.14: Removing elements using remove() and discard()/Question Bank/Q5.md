### Q5: Task Queue Processor

**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Category:** Application
**Type:** Coding

**Problem Statement:**

Create a task queue processing system that:
1. Maintains pending, processing, and completed task sets
2. Moves tasks between states using remove() and discard()
3. Handles task state transitions safely
4. Detects and reports invalid transitions
5. Provides queue statistics

Task lifecycle: pending → processing → completed

**Input:**
```
pending: task1 task2 task3 task4 task5
start task1
start task6
complete task1
complete task1
start task2
fail task2
start task3
complete task3
stats
```

First line: initial pending tasks
Following lines: commands (start/complete/fail task_id, or stats)

**Output:**
```
Started task1 (pending → processing)
Cannot start task6: not in pending queue
Completed task1 (processing → completed)
Cannot complete task1: not in processing
Started task2 (pending → processing)
Failed task2 (processing → pending)
Started task3 (pending → processing)
Completed task3 (processing → completed)
--- Queue Statistics ---
Pending: 3 tasks (task2 task4 task5)
Processing: 0 tasks ()
Completed: 2 tasks (task1 task3)
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ initial tasks ≤ 50
- Task IDs are alphanumeric
- 1 ≤ commands ≤ 100
- Valid transitions: pending→processing, processing→completed, processing→pending (fail)

**Notes:**
- Use remove() when you expect the task to be in a specific state
- Use discard() when state is uncertain
- Catch KeyError and provide meaningful messages
