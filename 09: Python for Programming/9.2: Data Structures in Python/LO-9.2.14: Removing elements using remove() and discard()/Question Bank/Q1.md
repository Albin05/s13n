### Q1: Shopping Cart Removal

**Duration:** 3 minutes
**Difficulty:** Low
**Category:** Implementation
**Type:** Coding

**Problem Statement:**

Create a program that manages a shopping cart. The program should:
- Accept commands to remove items from the cart
- Use remove() when the item must exist (strict mode)
- Use discard() when the item might not exist (safe mode)
- Handle errors appropriately

**Input:**
```
cart: BOOK001 LAPTOP042 MOUSE015
strict MOUSE015
safe PHONE099
strict BOOK001
safe BOOK001
show
```

First line: initial cart items (space-separated)
Following lines: commands in format "mode item" where mode is "strict" or "safe"
Last command: "show" to display final cart

**Output:**
```
Removed MOUSE015 (strict)
Item PHONE099 safely removed (safe)
Removed BOOK001 (strict)
Item BOOK001 safely removed (safe)
Final cart: LAPTOP042
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ items in cart ≤ 20
- Item IDs are alphanumeric strings
- 1 ≤ commands ≤ 30
