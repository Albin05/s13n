**Duration:** 3 minutes
**Difficulty:** Low
**Category:** Implementation
**Type:** Coding

**Problem Statement:**

Write a program that manages active user sessions. The program should:
- Track active sessions
- Remove sessions using discard() for safe cleanup
- Report the number of sessions before and after cleanup

**Input:**
```
5
sess_001 sess_002 sess_003 sess_004 sess_005
3
sess_002 sess_006 sess_004
```

First line: number of initial sessions
Second line: space-separated session IDs
Third line: number of sessions to remove
Fourth line: space-separated session IDs to remove (some may not exist)

**Output:**
```
Initial sessions: 5
Removing sess_002... found and removed
Removing sess_006... not found
Removing sess_004... found and removed
Active sessions: 3
Remaining: sess_001 sess_003 sess_005
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ initial sessions ≤ 50
- 1 ≤ sessions to remove ≤ 50
- Session IDs format: sess_NNN
