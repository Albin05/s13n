### Q3: Feature Flag Manager

**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Category:** Implementation
**Type:** Coding

**Problem Statement:**

Create a feature flag management system that:
1. Starts with a set of enabled features
2. Processes enable/disable commands
3. Uses discard() for safe disable operations
4. Reports feature status after each command
5. Validates that critical features cannot be disabled

Critical features: ['authentication', 'security']

**Input:**
```
5
authentication security logging analytics dashboard
disable logging
disable authentication
enable notifications
disable analytics
status
```

First line: number of initial features
Second line: space-separated feature names
Following lines: commands (enable/disable feature_name or status)

**Output:**
```
Disabled logging (5 → 4 features)
Cannot disable critical feature: authentication
Enabled notifications (4 → 5 features)
Disabled analytics (5 → 4 features)
Active features: authentication dashboard notifications security
Critical features intact: authentication security
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ features ≤ 30
- Feature names are lowercase words
- Critical features cannot be disabled
- 1 ≤ commands ≤ 50
