### Q5: CSV Data Processor (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write a program that processes CSV-like data:

1. Create a list of CSV strings representing employees:
   ```python
   csv_data = [
       "101,Alice,Engineering,95000,5",
       "102,Bob,Marketing,75000,3",
       "103,Charlie,Engineering,105000,7",
       "104,Diana,HR,65000,2",
       "105,Eve,Engineering,98000,4"
   ]
   ```

2. Write a function `parse_employee(csv_string)` that:
   - Splits the CSV string
   - Unpacks into: id, name, department, salary, years
   - Converts numeric values to appropriate types
   - Returns a tuple: `(id, name, department, salary, years)`

3. Write a function `calculate_bonus(employee)` that:
   - Unpacks employee tuple
   - Calculates bonus:
     - Base: 5% of salary
     - Add 1% per year of service
     - Engineers get additional 2%
   - Returns tuple: `(name, bonus)`

4. Process all employees and print:
   - Each employee's bonus
   - Total bonus budget
   - Department with highest total bonuses

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice (Engineering, 5 years): Bonus = $11400.00
Bob (Marketing, 3 years): Bonus = $6000.00
Charlie (Engineering, 7 years): Bonus = $14700.00
Diana (HR, 2 years): Bonus = $4550.00
Eve (Engineering, 4 years): Bonus = $10780.00

Total bonus budget: $47430.00
Department with highest bonuses: Engineering ($36880.00)
```

**Key Concepts:**
- String parsing and unpacking
- Type conversion after unpacking
- Packing and unpacking in functions
- Complex data processing
- Aggregation by category
- Extended unpacking for flexible data handling

**Bonus Challenge:**
Modify the program to handle employees with optional fields (some may have fewer than 5 fields) using extended unpacking.

### Additional Practice Problems

**Practice 1: Fibonacci with Unpacking**
Write a function that generates the first n Fibonacci numbers using tuple unpacking for state updates.

**Practice 2: Matrix Operations**
Create functions for matrix addition and multiplication that use unpacking to process row and column data.

**Practice 3: Dictionary Unpacking**
Write a function that accepts `**kwargs` and uses unpacking to process configuration options with defaults.

**Practice 4: Nested Unpacking**
Process a list of nested tuples representing hierarchical data (e.g., `('Department', [('Team', [('Employee', )]))]`)

**Practice 5: Zip and Unpack**
Combine multiple lists using zip and unpack in a loop to process parallel data streams.
