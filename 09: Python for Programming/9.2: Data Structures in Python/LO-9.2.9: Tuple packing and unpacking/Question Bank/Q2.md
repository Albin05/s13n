### Q2: Extended Unpacking with * Operator (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

Write a program that:
1. Creates a tuple `scores` with test scores: `(95, 88, 92, 78, 85, 90, 87)`
2. Uses extended unpacking to extract:
   - First score into variable `first`
   - Last score into variable `last`
   - All middle scores into list `middle`
3. Calculates and prints:
   - The first and last scores
   - The average of middle scores
   - How many middle scores there are

**Expected Output:**
```
First score: 95
Last score: 87
Middle scores: [88, 92, 78, 85, 90]
Number of middle scores: 5
Average of middle scores: 86.6
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Extended unpacking with *
- Collecting remaining elements
- Processing unpacked data
