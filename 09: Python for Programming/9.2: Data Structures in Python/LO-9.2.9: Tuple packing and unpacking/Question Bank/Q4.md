### Q4: Student Grade Analyzer (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write a program that analyzes student grades:

1. Create a list of student records (tuples):
   ```python
   students = [
       ('Alice', 85, 90, 88, 92),
       ('Bob', 78, 82, 75, 80),
       ('Charlie', 92, 95, 93, 90),
       ('Diana', 88, 85, 90, 87)
   ]
   ```

2. Write a function `analyze_student(student)` that:
   - Unpacks name and all test scores
   - Calculates average, highest, and lowest scores
   - Returns tuple: `(name, average, highest, lowest, passed)`
     - `passed` is True if average >= 85, False otherwise

3. Process all students and print:
   - Each student's analysis
   - Names of students who passed
   - Class average

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice: Avg=88.75, High=92, Low=85, Status=PASS
Bob: Avg=78.75, High=82, Low=75, Status=FAIL
Charlie: Avg=92.50, High=95, Low=90, Status=PASS
Diana: Avg=87.50, High=90, Low=85, Status=PASS

Students who passed: Alice, Charlie, Diana
Class average: 86.88
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Unpacking variable-length tuples
- Extended unpacking with *
- Packing function returns
- Loop unpacking
- Data aggregation
