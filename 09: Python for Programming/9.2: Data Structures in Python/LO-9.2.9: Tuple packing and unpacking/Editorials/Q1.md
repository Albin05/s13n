### Q1 Solution: Basic Tuple Unpacking

```python
# 1. Create student tuple
student = ('Alice', 20, 'Computer Science', 3.8)

# 2. Unpack into variables
name, age, major, gpa = student

# 3. Print formatted information
print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Age: {age}")
print(f"Major: {major}")
print(f"GPA: {gpa}")

# 4. Swap age and gpa using tuple unpacking
age, gpa = gpa, age

# 5. Print swapped values
print(f"\nAfter swap:")
print(f"Age: {age}")
print(f"GPA: {gpa}")
```

**Explanation:**

**Step 1: Basic Unpacking**
```python
name, age, major, gpa = student
```
- The tuple has 4 elements
- We provide 4 variables on the left
- Each element is assigned in order

**Step 2: Variable Swapping**
```python
age, gpa = gpa, age
```
- Right side evaluated first: `(gpa, age)` → `(3.8, 20)`
- This tuple is then unpacked: `age = 3.8, gpa = 20`
- No temporary variable needed!

**Key Concepts:**
- Number of variables must match number of elements
- Swapping is elegant with tuple unpacking
- Right side always evaluated before assignment
