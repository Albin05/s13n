### Q4 Solution: Student Grade Analyzer

```python
# 1. Student records
students = [
    ('Alice', 85, 90, 88, 92),
    ('Bob', 78, 82, 75, 80),
    ('Charlie', 92, 95, 93, 90),
    ('Diana', 88, 85, 90, 87)
]

# 2. Analyze function
def analyze_student(student):
    # Unpack name and all scores using extended unpacking
    name, *test_scores = student
    
    # Calculate statistics
    average = sum(test_scores) / len(test_scores)
    highest = max(test_scores)
    lowest = min(test_scores)
    passed = average >= 85
    
    # Pack and return results
    return name, average, highest, lowest, passed

# 3. Process all students
passed_students = []
all_averages = []

for student in students:
    # Unpack analysis results
    name, avg, high, low, passed = analyze_student(student)
    
    # Store data
    all_averages.append(avg)
    if passed:
        passed_students.append(name)
    
    # Print analysis
    status = "PASS" if passed else "FAIL"
    print(f"{name}: Avg={avg:.2f}, High={high}, Low={low}, Status={status}")

# Print summary
print(f"\nStudents who passed: {', '.join(passed_students)}")

class_average = sum(all_averages) / len(all_averages)
print(f"Class average: {class_average:.2f}")
```

**Explanation:**

**Extended Unpacking for Variable-Length Data:**
```python
name, *test_scores = student
```
- `name` gets first element: `'Alice'`
- `*test_scores` collects rest: `[85, 90, 88, 92]`
- Works regardless of how many test scores there are!

**Packing Return Values:**
```python
return name, average, highest, lowest, passed
```
- Returns a tuple of 5 elements
- Automatically packed by comma separation

**Unpacking Return Values:**
```python
name, avg, high, low, passed = analyze_student(student)
```
- Function returns a tuple
- Immediately unpack into separate variables

**Processing Flow:**
1. Loop through students
2. Each student is a tuple
3. Pass to function
4. Function unpacks, processes, packs results
5. Caller unpacks results
6. Process and aggregate data
