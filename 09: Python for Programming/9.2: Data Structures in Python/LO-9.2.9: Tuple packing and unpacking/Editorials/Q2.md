### Q2 Solution: Extended Unpacking with * Operator

```python
# 1. Create scores tuple
scores = (95, 88, 92, 78, 85, 90, 87)

# 2. Extended unpacking
first, *middle, last = scores

# 3. Print results
print(f"First score: {first}")
print(f"Last score: {last}")
print(f"Middle scores: {middle}")
print(f"Number of middle scores: {len(middle)}")

# Calculate average of middle scores
middle_average = sum(middle) / len(middle)
print(f"Average of middle scores: {middle_average:.1f}")
```

**Explanation:**

**Extended Unpacking Pattern:**
```python
first, *middle, last = scores
```
- `first` gets the first element: `95`
- `last` gets the last element: `87`
- `*middle` collects everything in between: `[88, 92, 78, 85, 90]`

**Important Notes:**
1. The `*` creates a **list**, not a tuple
2. If there's nothing in the middle, `middle` would be `[]`
3. Only one `*` allowed per unpacking

**Alternative Patterns:**
```python
# Get first and rest
first, *rest = scores

# Get all but last
*beginning, last = scores

# Get first, second, and rest
first, second, *rest = scores
```
