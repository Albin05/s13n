### Q1 Solution: Basic Difference Operations

```python
fruits_i_like = {'apple', 'banana', 'mango', 'grape', 'orange'}
fruits_in_stock = {'banana', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'pear', 'orange'}

# 1. Want but unavailable
unavailable = fruits_i_like - fruits_in_stock
print(f"Want but unavailable: {unavailable}")

# 2. Available but don't like
dont_like = fruits_in_stock - fruits_i_like
print(f"Available but don't like: {dont_like}")

# 3. Non-overlapping
non_overlapping = fruits_i_like ^ fruits_in_stock
print(f"Non-overlapping: {non_overlapping}")
```

**Explanation:**
- `fruits_i_like - fruits_in_stock` → items I want that aren't available
- `fruits_in_stock - fruits_i_like` → items available that I don't want
- `fruits_i_like ^ fruits_in_stock` → combines both of the above (everything not shared)
