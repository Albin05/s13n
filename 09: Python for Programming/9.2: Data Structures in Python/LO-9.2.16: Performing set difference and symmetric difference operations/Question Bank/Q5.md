### Q5: Course Recommendation Engine (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

```python
courses = {
    'Alice': {'Math', 'Physics', 'Chemistry'},
    'Bob': {'Math', 'Biology', 'History'},
    'Charlie': {'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Art'},
    'Diana': {'Math', 'Physics', 'Music'}
}
```

Write functions:
1. `unique_courses(student1, student2)` — courses one has that the other doesn't (symmetric difference)
2. `recommend(student, friend)` — courses the friend takes that the student doesn't (difference)
3. `exclusive_courses(student)` — courses only this student takes (no one else does)

Test with:
- Unique courses between Alice and Bob
- Recommendations for Alice based on Diana
- Exclusive courses for each student

**Expected Output:**
```
Unique between Alice & Bob: {'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Biology', 'History'}
Recommend for Alice from Diana: {'Music'}
Charlie exclusive: {'Art'}
Bob exclusive: {'Biology', 'History'}
Diana exclusive: {'Music'}
Alice exclusive: set()
```

**Key Concepts:** Symmetric difference, difference, iterating with sets
