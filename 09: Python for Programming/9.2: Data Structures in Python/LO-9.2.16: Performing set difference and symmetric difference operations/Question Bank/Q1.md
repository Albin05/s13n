### Q1: Basic Difference Operations (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

Given two sets:
```python
fruits_i_like = {'apple', 'banana', 'mango', 'grape', 'orange'}
fruits_in_stock = {'banana', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'pear', 'orange'}
```

Write a program that prints:
1. Fruits I like that are NOT in stock
2. Fruits in stock that I DON'T like
3. Fruits that are either liked or in stock, but not both

**Expected Output:**
```
Want but unavailable: {'apple', 'mango'}
Available but don't like: {'kiwi', 'pear'}
Non-overlapping: {'apple', 'mango', 'kiwi', 'pear'}
```

**Key Concepts:** Set difference, symmetric difference
