### Q5: Student Course Enrollment System (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write a program that manages student course enrollments:

1. Create enrollment data:
   ```python
   enrollments = {
       'Alice': {'Math', 'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'English'},
       'Bob': {'Math', 'Chemistry', 'Biology', 'History'},
       'Charlie': {'Math', 'English', 'Art', 'Music'},
       'Diana': {'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Biology', 'Math'}
   }
   ```

2. Write a function `find_common_courses(*students)` that:
   - Takes variable number of student names
   - Returns courses ALL specified students are taking
   - Use set intersection

3. Write a function `find_any_courses(*students)` that:
   - Returns all courses ANY of the students are taking
   - Use set union

4. Write a function `can_form_study_group(students, min_common)` that:
   - Checks if students have at least `min_common` courses together
   - Returns True/False

5. Write a function `course_statistics(enrollments)` that returns:
   - Total number of unique courses
   - Most popular course (appears in most student schedules)
   - Students taking the most courses

6. Perform analysis:
   - Find courses Alice and Bob share
   - Find courses only Diana is taking (that no one else is)
   - Can Alice, Bob, and Charlie form a study group? (need 2+ common courses)
   - Get course statistics

**Expected Output:**
```
Common courses (Alice & Bob): {'Math', 'Chemistry'}

Courses only Diana takes: set() or {'Biology'} (depending on interpretation)

All courses any of them take: {'Math', 'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'English', 'Biology', 'History', 'Art', 'Music'}

Can Alice, Bob, Charlie form study group (min 2 common)? True
Common: {'Math'}

Course Statistics:
  Total unique courses: 10
  Most popular course: Math (4 students)
  Students with most courses: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana (tied at 4 courses each)
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Multiple set operations
- Variable arguments with sets
- Set intersection across multiple sets
- Data analysis with sets
- Practical enrollment management

**Bonus Challenge:**
Write a function that suggests courses for a student based on:
- What courses their friends are taking
- That they're not already enrolled in
- That appear in at least 2 of their friends' schedules

### Additional Practice Problems

**Practice 1: Unique Character Counter**
Write a program that finds all unique characters in a string and counts how many unique characters two strings share.

**Practice 2: Permission System**
Create a role-based permission system using sets. Check if a user has required permissions, find missing permissions, etc.

**Practice 3: Inventory Management**
Use sets to track inventory across multiple warehouses. Find items available in all warehouses, items only in specific warehouses, etc.

**Practice 4: Email List Manager**
Manage email lists using sets. Find subscribers to multiple lists, unique subscribers, unsubscribe from all lists, etc.

**Practice 5: Spell Checker**
Create a simple spell checker using a set of valid words. Find misspelled words, suggest corrections based on similar valid words.
