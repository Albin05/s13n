### Q2: Removing Duplicates (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

Write a program that:
1. Creates a list with duplicate values:
   ```python
   scores = [85, 92, 78, 92, 85, 88, 95, 78, 92]
   ```
2. Converts the list to a set to remove duplicates
3. Converts back to a sorted list
4. Prints:
   - Original list length
   - Number of unique scores
   - Sorted unique scores

**Expected Output:**
```
Original list length: 9
Number of unique scores: 5
Unique scores (sorted): [78, 85, 88, 92, 95]
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Converting between lists and sets
- Automatic duplicate removal
- Sorting sets
