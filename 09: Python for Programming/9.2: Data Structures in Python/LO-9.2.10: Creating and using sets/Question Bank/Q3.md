### Q3: Social Network Analysis (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write a program that analyzes social connections:

1. Create three sets representing friend lists:
   ```python
   alice_friends = {'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve'}
   bob_friends = {'Alice', 'Charlie', 'Frank', 'Diana'}
   charlie_friends = {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Eve', 'George'}
   ```

2. Find and print:
   - Mutual friends between Alice and Bob
   - Friends only Alice has (not Bob)
   - Friends only Bob has (not Alice)
   - All unique people in the network (union of all three)
   - Friends that all three have in common

3. Write a function `suggest_friends(person_friends, other_friends)` that:
   - Takes two friend sets
   - Returns friends of friends (people in other_friends but not in person_friends)
   - These are friend suggestions!

4. Get friend suggestions for Alice based on Bob's friends

**Expected Output:**
```
Mutual friends (Alice & Bob): {'Charlie', 'Diana'}
Only Alice has: {'Eve'}
Only Bob has: {'Frank'}
All people in network: {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve', 'Frank', 'George'}
Friends all three have: {'Alice', 'Bob'} or set() (depends on interpretation)

Friend suggestions for Alice (from Bob's friends): {'Frank'}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Set intersection (mutual friends)
- Set difference (unique friends)
- Set union (all people)
- Practical set applications
- Friend recommendation algorithm
