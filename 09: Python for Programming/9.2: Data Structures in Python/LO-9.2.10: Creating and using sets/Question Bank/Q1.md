### Q1: Basic Set Operations (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

Write a program that:
1. Creates a set `numbers` with values: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
2. Adds the number `6` to the set
3. Tries to add the number `3` again (observe what happens)
4. Removes the number `2` using `remove()`
5. Removes the number `10` using `discard()` (note the difference)
6. Prints the final set and its length

**Expected Output:**
```
After adding 6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
After trying to add 3 again: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
After removing 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
After discarding 10: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Final set: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Length: 5
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Creating sets
- Adding elements
- Duplicate handling
- Removing elements (remove vs discard)
