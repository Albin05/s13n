### Q4 Solution: Student Grade Management

```python
# Create student list
students = [
    ['Alice', 85, 90, 88],
    ['Bob', 78, 82, 86],
    ['Charlie', 92, 89, 94],
    ['Diana', 88, 91, 87]
]

# Print all students
print("All students:")
print(students)

# Calculate averages
print("\nStudent Averages:")
for student in students:
    name = student[0]
    grades = student[1:4]  # Math, Science, English
    average = sum(grades) / len(grades)
    print(f"{name}: {average:.2f}")

# Find highest math grade
highest_math = students[0]
for student in students:
    if student[1] > highest_math[1]:
        highest_math = student

print(f"\nHighest math grade: {highest_math[0]} with {highest_math[1]}")
```

**Explanation:**
- Each student is a nested list
- `student[0]` is name, `student[1:4]` are grades
- `sum(grades)` adds all grades
- Loop through to find maximum
- Compare `student[1]` (math grade)
- Track student with highest math score
