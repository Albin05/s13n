### Q4: Student Grade Management (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Create a list to store information for 4 students. Each student should be a nested list containing: [name, math_grade, science_grade, english_grade].

Students:
- Alice: 85, 90, 88
- Bob: 78, 82, 86  
- Charlie: 92, 89, 94
- Diana: 88, 91, 87

Then:
1. Print all students
2. Calculate and print the average for each student
3. Find the student with the highest math grade

**Expected Output:**
```
All students:
[['Alice', 85, 90, 88], ['Bob', 78, 82, 86], ['Charlie', 92, 89, 94], ['Diana', 88, 91, 87]]

Student Averages:
Alice: 87.67
Bob: 82.00
Charlie: 91.67
Diana: 88.67

Highest math grade: Charlie with 92
```

**Category:** Application  
**Prerequisite LOs:** 9.1.1, 9.1.2
