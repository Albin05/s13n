# LO-2.5: Iterating Through Lists Using Loops

## Learning Objective
Students will be able to iterate through lists using various loop techniques (for loops, enumerate, range, zip) to process, transform, and analyze list data in Python.

## Duration
25-30 minutes

## Key Concepts Covered
1. Basic for loop syntax for list iteration
2. Using enumerate() to access index and value
3. Using range() for index-based iteration
4. Using zip() to iterate multiple lists together
5. Loop control with break and continue
6. Common iteration patterns (accumulation, filtering, transformation, search)
7. Best practices and common pitfalls

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of lists and list basics (LO-2.1)
- Knowledge of list indexing (LO-2.2)
- Familiarity with basic loop concepts (while and for loops)
- Understanding of conditionals (if/elif/else)

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Write for loops to iterate through lists and process each element
- Use enumerate() to access both index and value during iteration
- Apply range(len(list)) pattern for index-based modifications
- Combine multiple lists using zip() for parallel processing
- Implement break and continue for loop control
- Recognize and apply common iteration patterns (sum, filter, transform, search)
- Choose the appropriate iteration method for different scenarios
- Avoid common mistakes like modifying lists during iteration
- Write clean, efficient, and Pythonic iteration code

## Real-World Applications
- Processing student grades to calculate class statistics
- Analyzing sensor data from IoT devices
- Validating and filtering user input data
- Transforming data formats (e.g., temperature conversion)
- Building shopping cart functionality with price calculations
- Searching for specific items in large datasets
- Generating reports from multi-column data
- Processing log files and extracting information
