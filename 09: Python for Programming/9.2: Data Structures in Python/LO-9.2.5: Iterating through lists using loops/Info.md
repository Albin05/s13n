### Prerequisites

- LO-9.2.1: Creating and initializing lists in Python
- LO-9.2.2: Accessing list elements using indexing
- LO-9.2.3: Extracting list portions using slicing

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

2. Use enumerate() to get index and value
3. Iterate with while loops and indices
4. Loop through multiple lists simultaneously with zip()
5. Modify lists while iterating safely
