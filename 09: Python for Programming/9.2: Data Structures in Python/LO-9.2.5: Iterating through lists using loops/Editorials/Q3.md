### Q3 Solution: Parallel List Processing with zip()

```python
products = ['Laptop', 'Mouse', 'Keyboard', 'Monitor', 'USB Cable']
prices = [999.99, 29.99, 79.99, 299.99, 9.99]
quantities = [5, 50, 30, 10, 100]

# 1. Print inventory
print("Inventory:")
for product, price, qty in zip(products, prices, quantities):
    total = price * qty
    print(f"{product}: ${price:.2f} × {qty} = ${total:.2f}")
print()

# 2-3. Calculate totals and find highest
product_values = []
for product, price, qty in zip(products, prices, quantities):
    total_value = price * qty
    product_values.append((product, total_value))

highest = max(product_values, key=lambda x: x[1])
print(f"Highest value product: {highest[0]} (${highest[1]:.2f})")

# 4. Total inventory value
inventory_value = 0
for price, qty in zip(prices, quantities):
    inventory_value += price * qty
print(f"Total inventory value: ${inventory_value:.2f}")
print()

# 5. Create list of tuples
product_details = []
for product, price, qty in zip(products, prices, quantities):
    total_value = price * qty
    product_details.append((product, price, qty, total_value))

print("Product details:")
for detail in product_details:
    print(detail)
```

**Explanation:**
- `zip()` combines multiple lists element by element
- Returns tuples that can be unpacked in loop
- Stops at shortest list
- Perfect for parallel data processing

**zip() Pattern:**
- Use when you have related data in separate lists
- Cleaner than indexing multiple lists
- Can zip 2, 3, or more lists together
