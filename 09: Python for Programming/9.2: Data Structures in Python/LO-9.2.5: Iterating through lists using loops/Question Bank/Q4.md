### Q4: Temperature Analysis (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
You have daily high temperatures for a week:
```python
days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']
temps = [72, 68, 75, 80, 78, 82, 79]
```

Write a program that:
1. Prints each day with its temperature
2. Finds the hottest and coldest days
3. Calculates the average temperature
4. Counts how many days were above average
5. Creates a "comfort rating" for each day:
   - "Cold" if temp < 70
   - "Comfortable" if 70 ≤ temp ≤ 78
   - "Hot" if temp > 78

Print a formatted report.

**Expected Output:**
```
Weekly Temperatures:
Monday: 72°F
Tuesday: 68°F
Wednesday: 75°F
Thursday: 80°F
Friday: 78°F
Saturday: 82°F
Sunday: 79°F

Analysis:
Hottest: Saturday (82°F)
Coldest: Tuesday (68°F)
Average: 76.3°F
Days above average: 4

Comfort Ratings:
Monday: 72°F - Comfortable
Tuesday: 68°F - Cold
Wednesday: 75°F - Comfortable
Thursday: 80°F - Hot
Friday: 78°F - Comfortable
Saturday: 82°F - Hot
Sunday: 79°F - Hot
```
