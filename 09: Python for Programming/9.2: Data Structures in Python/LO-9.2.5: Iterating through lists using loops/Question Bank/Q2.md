### Q2: Using enumerate() (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Given `fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'grape']`:

1. Print each fruit with its index (0-based)
2. Print each fruit with position number (1-based)
3. Find and print indices of all fruits with more than 5 letters
4. Print fruits at even indices only
5. Create a dictionary mapping index to fruit name

**Expected Output:**
```
With index:
0: apple
1: banana
2: orange
3: mango
4: grape

With position:
1. apple
2. banana
3. orange
4. mango
5. grape

Long fruits (>5 letters):
Index 1: banana (6 letters)
Index 2: orange (6 letters)

Fruits at even indices:
0: apple
2: orange
4: grape

Dictionary: {0: 'apple', 1: 'banana', 2: 'orange', 3: 'mango', 4: 'grape'}
```
