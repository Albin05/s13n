### Q3: Parallel List Processing with zip() (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
You have three parallel lists:
```python
products = ['Laptop', 'Mouse', 'Keyboard', 'Monitor', 'USB Cable']
prices = [999.99, 29.99, 79.99, 299.99, 9.99]
quantities = [5, 50, 30, 10, 100]
```

Using zip(), create a program that:
1. Prints each product with its price and quantity
2. Calculates total value for each product (price × quantity)
3. Finds the product with highest total value
4. Calculates total inventory value (sum of all product values)
5. Creates a list of tuples: (product, price, quantity, total_value)

**Expected Output:**
```
Inventory:
Laptop: $999.99 × 5 = $4999.95
Mouse: $29.99 × 50 = $1499.50
Keyboard: $79.99 × 30 = $2399.70
Monitor: $299.99 × 10 = $2999.90
USB Cable: $9.99 × 100 = $999.00

Highest value product: Laptop ($4999.95)
Total inventory value: $12898.05

Product details:
[('Laptop', 999.99, 5, 4999.95),
 ('Mouse', 29.99, 50, 1499.50),
 ('Keyboard', 79.99, 30, 2399.70),
 ('Monitor', 299.99, 10, 2999.90),
 ('USB Cable', 9.99, 100, 999.00)]
```
