### Q5: Grade Book Manager (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
You have a grade book with students and their scores in three subjects:
```python
students = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve']
math_scores = [85, 92, 78, 88, 95]
science_scores = [90, 88, 82, 91, 89]
english_scores = [88, 85, 90, 87, 92]
```

Create a program that:
1. Calculates each student's average score
2. Determines letter grade (A: ≥90, B: ≥80, C: ≥70, D: ≥60, F: <60)
3. Finds the student with highest overall average
4. Finds which subject has the highest class average
5. Creates a report card for each student

Print a comprehensive report.

**Expected Output:**
```
Student Averages:
Alice: 87.7 (B)
Bob: 88.3 (B)
Charlie: 83.3 (B)
Diana: 88.7 (B)
Eve: 92.0 (A)

Top student: Eve (92.0)

Subject Averages:
Math: 87.6
Science: 88.0
English: 88.4
Highest class average: English (88.4)

Report Cards:
===== Alice =====
Math: 85
Science: 90
English: 88
Average: 87.7
Grade: B

===== Bob =====
Math: 92
Science: 88
English: 85
Average: 88.3
Grade: B

[... and so on for each student]
```
