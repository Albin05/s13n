### Q3: Unique Word Counter (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write a program that analyzes text for unique words:

```python
text = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the fox the dog"
```

1. Split the text into words
2. Find all unique words (case-insensitive)
3. Print the total word count and unique word count
4. Print the unique words in alphabetical order
5. Find words that appear more than once

**Expected Output:**
```
Total words: 12
Unique words: 8
Alphabetical: ['brown', 'dog', 'fox', 'jumps', 'lazy', 'over', 'quick', 'the']
Repeated words: {'the', 'fox', 'dog'}
```

**Key Concepts:** String splitting, case-insensitive comparison, set operations
