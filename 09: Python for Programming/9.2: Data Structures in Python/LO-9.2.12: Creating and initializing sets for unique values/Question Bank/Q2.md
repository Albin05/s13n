### Q2: Duplicate Removal (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

Given the following list of student IDs with duplicates:
```python
student_ids = [101, 203, 101, 305, 203, 407, 305, 509, 101, 407]
```

Write a program that:
1. Prints the original list and its length
2. Converts it to a set and prints the unique IDs
3. Converts back to a sorted list and prints it
4. Prints how many duplicates were removed

**Expected Output:**
```
Original: [101, 203, 101, 305, 203, 407, 305, 509, 101, 407]
Original count: 10
Unique IDs: {101, 203, 305, 407, 509}
Sorted unique: [101, 203, 305, 407, 509]
Duplicates removed: 5
```

**Key Concepts:** List to set conversion, duplicate counting, sorting
