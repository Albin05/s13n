### Q5 Solution: Email Deduplication

```python
emails = [
    'alice@mail.com', 'Bob@Mail.com', 'alice@mail.com',
    'charlie@mail.com', 'bob@mail.com', 'ALICE@MAIL.COM',
    'diana@mail.com', 'Charlie@Mail.com'
]

# 1. Normalize to lowercase
normalized = [email.lower() for email in emails]

# 2. Unique emails
unique_emails = set(normalized)

# 3. Counts
print(f"Original count: {len(emails)}")
print(f"Unique count: {len(unique_emails)}")

# 4. Find duplicates
seen = set()
duplicates = set()
for email in normalized:
    if email in seen:
        duplicates.add(email)
    seen.add(email)
print(f"Emails with duplicates: {duplicates}")

# 5. Clean sorted list
print("Clean mailing list:")
for email in sorted(unique_emails):
    print(f"  {email}")
```

**Explanation:**
- Emails are case-insensitive, so `'Alice@Mail.com'` and `'alice@mail.com'` are the same. We normalize with `.lower()`.
- Converting to a set removes duplicates. The difference in counts reveals how many were duplicated.
- To identify *which* emails had duplicates, we track seen emails and flag any that appear again.
- `sorted()` gives us a clean, alphabetically ordered mailing list.
