### Q3 Solution: Unique Word Counter

```python
text = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the fox the dog"

# 1. Split into words
words = text.lower().split()
print(f"Total words: {len(words)}")

# 2. Unique words
unique_words = set(words)
print(f"Unique words: {len(unique_words)}")

# 3. Alphabetical
print(f"Alphabetical: {sorted(unique_words)}")

# 4. Repeated words
word_counts = {}
for word in words:
    word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1

repeated = {word for word, count in word_counts.items() if count > 1}
print(f"Repeated words: {repeated}")
```

**Explanation:**
- `.lower().split()` normalizes case and splits by whitespace.
- `set(words)` gives unique words. `sorted()` puts them in alphabetical order.
- To find repeated words, we count occurrences with a dictionary, then use a set comprehension to filter words appearing more than once.
