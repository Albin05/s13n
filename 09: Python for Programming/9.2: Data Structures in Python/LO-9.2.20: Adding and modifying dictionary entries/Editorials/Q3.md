### Q3 Solution: Word Frequency Counter

```python
text = "to be or not to be that is the question to be is to exist"
words = text.split()

freq = {}
for word in words:
    freq[word] = freq.get(word, 0) + 1
print(f"Frequencies: {freq}")

most_common = max(freq, key=freq.get)
print(f"Most common: \'{most_common}\' ({freq[most_common]} times)")

once = [w for w, c in freq.items() if c == 1]
print(f"Appear once: {once}")

three_plus = [w for w, c in freq.items() if c >= 3]
print(f"Appear 3+ times: {three_plus}")
```
