### Q3: Word Frequency Counter (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

```python
text = "to be or not to be that is the question to be is to exist"
```

1. Build a frequency dictionary using `.get()` pattern
2. Find the most common word
3. Find words that appear exactly once
4. Find words that appear more than twice

**Expected Output:**
```
Frequencies: {'to': 4, 'be': 3, 'or': 1, 'not': 1, ...}
Most common: 'to' (4 times)
Appear once: ['or', 'not', 'that', 'the', 'question', 'exist']
Appear 3+ times: ['to', 'be']
```

**Key Concepts:** Counter pattern with `.get()`, dict comprehension
