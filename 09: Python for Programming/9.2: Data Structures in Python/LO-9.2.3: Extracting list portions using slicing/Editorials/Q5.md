### Q5 Solution: Sales Data Processing

```python
sales = [120, 135, 142, 128, 156, 189, 201, 145, 132, 128,
         167, 178, 192, 205, 198, 176, 188, 194, 203, 210,
         189, 176, 182, 195, 208, 215, 198, 187, 179, 165]

# 1. Week 1 and Week 4
week1 = sales[0:7]
week4 = sales[21:28]
print(f"Week 1 sales: {week1}")
print(f"  Total: ${sum(week1)}\n")
print(f"Week 4 sales: {week4}")
print(f"  Total: ${sum(week4)}\n")

# 2. Weekend sales (positions 5-6, 12-13, 19-20, 26-27)
# Extracting individually then combining
weekends = sales[5:7] + sales[12:14] + sales[19:21] + sales[26:28]
print(f"Weekend sales: {weekends}")
print(f"  Total: ${sum(weekends)}\n")

# 3. Weekly summary (every 7th day)
weekly = sales[::7]
print(f"Weekly summary (every 7th): {weekly}")
print(f"  Total: ${sum(weekly)}\n")

# 4. Second half
mid = len(sales) // 2
second_half = sales[mid:]
print(f"Second half: {second_half}")
print(f"  Total: ${sum(second_half)}\n")

# 5. Last 10 days reversed
last_10_rev = sales[-10:][::-1]
print(f"Last 10 days reversed: {last_10_rev}")
print(f"  Total: ${sum(last_10_rev)}")
```

**Explanation:**
- `sales[0:7]` - Days 0-6 (Week 1)
- `sales[21:28]` - Days 21-27 (Week 4)
- `sales[5:7] + sales[12:14] + ...` - Concatenate weekend slices
- `sales[::7]` - Every 7th day (day 0, 7, 14, 21)
- `sales[mid:]` - From middle to end
- `sales[-10:][::-1]` - Last 10 reversed (two operations)
  - First `[-10:]` gets last 10
  - Then `[::-1]` reverses them

**Advanced Patterns:**
- Concatenating multiple slices with `+`
- Using `len(sales) // 2` for dynamic midpoint
- Chaining slice operations: `sales[-10:][::-1]`
- Using `sum()` for totals

**Key Concepts:**
- Slicing extracts data without loops
- Can combine multiple slices
- Chain operations for complex transformations
- Perfect for time-series and sequential data analysis
