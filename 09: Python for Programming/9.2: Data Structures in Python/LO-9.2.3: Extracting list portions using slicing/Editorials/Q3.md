### Q3 Solution: Slice Assignment and Modification

```python
items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(f"Initial: {items}")

# 1. Replace 2-5 with [30, 40, 50]
items[2:5] = [30, 40, 50]
print(f"After replacing 2-5 with [30,40,50]: {items}")

# 2. Delete 5-7
items[5:7] = []
print(f"After deleting 5-7: {items}")

# 3. Insert [100, 200] at index 3
items[3:3] = [100, 200]
print(f"After inserting at 3: {items}")

# 4. Replace every second with zeros
# First, determine how many elements
num_elements = len(items[::2])
items[::2] = [0] * num_elements
print(f"After replacing evens with 0: {items}")
```

**Explanation:**
- `items[2:5] = [30, 40, 50]` - Replaces indices 2, 3, 4
- `items[5:7] = []` - Deletes by replacing with empty list
- `items[3:3] = [100, 200]` - Inserts at index 3 (empty slice)
- `items[::2] = [0] * num_elements` - Replaces every 2nd element

**Slice Assignment Rules:**
- Can replace with different length (except with step)
- Empty list deletes elements
- Zero-length slice (like [3:3]) inserts
- With step, replacement must be same length
