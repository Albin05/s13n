### Q2 Solution: Using Step in Slicing

```python
data = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

# 1. Every second element
every_2nd = data[::2]
print(f"Every 2nd: {every_2nd}")

# 2. Every third element
every_3rd = data[::3]
print(f"Every 3rd: {every_3rd}")

# 3. Every second from index 1
every_2nd_from_1 = data[1::2]
print(f"Every 2nd from index 1: {every_2nd_from_1}")

# 4. Reversed
reversed_data = data[::-1]
print(f"Reversed: {reversed_data}")

# 5. Every second in reverse
every_2nd_rev = data[::-2]
print(f"Every 2nd reversed: {every_2nd_rev}")
```

**Explanation:**
- `[::2]` - Start at 0, go to end, step by 2
- `[::3]` - Step by 3 through entire list
- `[1::2]` - Start at index 1, step by 2
- `[::-1]` - Negative step reverses the list
- `[::-2]` - Reverse and take every 2nd element

**Step Parameter:**
- Positive step: left to right
- Negative step: right to left
- Default step is 1
