### Q4: Temperature Data Analysis (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
You have hourly temperature readings for 24 hours:
```python
temps = [65, 66, 64, 63, 62, 61, 62, 64, 68, 72, 75, 78,
         80, 82, 83, 81, 79, 76, 73, 70, 68, 67, 66, 65]
```

Using slicing, extract and calculate:
1. Morning temperatures (hours 6-12, indices 6-12)
2. Afternoon temperatures (hours 12-18, indices 12-18)
3. Evening temperatures (hours 18-24, indices 18-24)
4. Peak hours (temperatures above 75 degrees - you'll need to identify these first)
5. Every 3rd hour reading for a summary report

For each, print the slice and its average temperature (rounded to 1 decimal).

**Expected Output:**
```
Morning (6-12): [62, 64, 68, 72, 75, 78]
  Average: 69.8°F

Afternoon (12-18): [80, 82, 83, 81, 79, 76]
  Average: 80.2°F

Evening (18-24): [73, 70, 68, 67, 66, 65]
  Average: 68.2°F

Every 3rd hour: [65, 63, 62, 72, 80, 81, 73, 66]
  Average: 70.2°F
```
