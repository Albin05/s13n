### Q1: Basic Slicing Operations (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Given the list `numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]`, use slicing to extract:
1. The first 4 elements
2. Elements from index 3 to 7
3. The last 3 elements
4. All elements except the first and last
5. Every element from index 5 to the end

**Expected Output:**
```
First 4: [10, 20, 30, 40]
Index 3 to 7: [40, 50, 60, 70]
Last 3: [80, 90, 100]
Except first and last: [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
From index 5: [60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
```
