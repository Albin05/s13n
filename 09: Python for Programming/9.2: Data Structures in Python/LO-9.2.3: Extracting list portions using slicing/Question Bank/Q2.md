### Q2: Using Step in Slicing (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Given `data = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`, extract:
1. Every second element
2. Every third element
3. Every second element starting from index 1
4. The entire list reversed
5. Every second element in reverse

**Expected Output:**
```
Every 2nd: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
Every 3rd: [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
Every 2nd from index 1: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
Reversed: [15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
Every 2nd reversed: [15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1]
```
