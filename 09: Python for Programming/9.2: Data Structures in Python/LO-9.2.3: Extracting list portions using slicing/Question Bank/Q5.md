### Q5: Sales Data Processing (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
A store's daily sales for a month (30 days) are stored in a list:
```python
sales = [120, 135, 142, 128, 156, 189, 201, 145, 132, 128,
         167, 178, 192, 205, 198, 176, 188, 194, 203, 210,
         189, 176, 182, 195, 208, 215, 198, 187, 179, 165]
```

Using slicing:
1. Extract Week 1 (days 0-7) and Week 4 (days 21-28)
2. Get all weekend sales (assuming Sat-Sun are at positions 5-6, 12-13, 19-20, 26-27)
3. Create a weekly summary showing every 7th day
4. Find the second half of the month
5. Reverse the last 10 days to see recent trend backwards

For each, show the slice and calculate total sales.

**Expected Output:**
```
Week 1 sales: [120, 135, 142, 128, 156, 189, 201]
  Total: $1071

Week 4 sales: [176, 182, 195, 208, 215, 198, 187]
  Total: $1361

Weekend sales: [189, 201, 178, 192, 194, 203, 182, 195]
  Total: $1534

Weekly summary (every 7th): [120, 145, 188, 189]
  Total: $642

Second half: [176, 188, 194, 203, 210, 189, 176, 182, 195, 208, 215, 198, 187, 179, 165]
  Total: $2865

Last 10 days reversed: [165, 179, 187, 198, 215, 208, 195, 182, 176, 189]
  Total: $1894
```
