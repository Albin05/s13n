### Q3: Slice Assignment and Modification (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Start with `items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

Perform these operations in sequence (each modifies the list):
1. Replace elements at indices 2-5 with `[30, 40, 50]`
2. Delete elements at indices 5-7
3. Insert `[100, 200]` at index 3
4. Replace every second element (starting from index 0) with zeros
5. Show the final list

**Expected Output:**
```
After replacing 2-5 with [30,40,50]: [1, 2, 30, 40, 50, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
After deleting 5-7: [1, 2, 30, 40, 50, 8, 9, 10]
After inserting at 3: [1, 2, 30, 100, 200, 40, 50, 8, 9, 10]
After replacing evens with 0: [0, 2, 0, 100, 0, 40, 0, 8, 0, 10]
```
