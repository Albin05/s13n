### Q4: Inventory Alert System (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

```python
inventory = {
    'laptop': {'stock': 5, 'min_stock': 10, 'price': 999},
    'mouse': {'stock': 50, 'min_stock': 20, 'price': 29},
    'keyboard': {'stock': 8, 'min_stock': 15, 'price': 79},
    'monitor': {'stock': 30, 'min_stock': 10, 'price': 399}
}
```

Write a program that:
1. Checks if each product has a 'discount' key — if not, set discount to 0
2. Finds products where stock is below min_stock
3. Checks if a searched product exists, prints info or "Not found"
4. Adds a new product only if it doesn't already exist

**Key Concepts:** `in` with nested dicts, conditional adding
