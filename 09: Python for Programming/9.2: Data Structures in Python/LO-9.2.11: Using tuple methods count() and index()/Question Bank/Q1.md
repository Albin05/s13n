### Q1: Basic count() and index() Usage (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

Write a program that:
1. Creates a tuple: `numbers = (5, 10, 5, 15, 20, 5, 25)`
2. Counts how many times `5` appears
3. Finds the index of the first occurrence of `10`
4. Finds the index of the second occurrence of `5`
5. Tries to find the index of `30` with error handling

**Expected Output:**
```
Count of 5: 3
First occurrence of 10 at index: 1
Second occurrence of 5 at index: 2
30 not found in tuple
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Using count() method
- Using index() method
- Finding nth occurrence
- Error handling with try-except
