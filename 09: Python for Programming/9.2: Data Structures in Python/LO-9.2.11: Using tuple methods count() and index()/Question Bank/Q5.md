### Q5: Data Validation System (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write a data validation system for a tuple of field names:

1. Write `check_duplicates(fields)` that:
   - Finds and returns any duplicate fields
   - Uses count() to detect duplicates
   - Returns list of duplicates (unique)

2. Write `check_required(provided, required)` that:
   - Checks if all required fields are in provided fields
   - Returns list of missing fields
   - Uses count() to verify presence

3. Write `get_duplicate_positions(fields)` that:
   - Returns dictionary mapping each duplicate to its positions
   - Uses find_all_indices approach

Test with:
```python
provided = ('name', 'email', 'name', 'age', 'email')
required = ('name', 'email', 'age', 'city')
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Duplicates found: ['name', 'email']
name appears at positions: [0, 2]
email appears at positions: [1, 4]

Missing required fields: ['city']
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Data validation
- Duplicate detection
- Required field checking
- Position mapping

### Additional Practice Problems

**Practice 1:** Write a function that finds the spacing (distance) between consecutive occurrences of a value in a tuple.

**Practice 2:** Implement a function that checks if a tuple has a specific pattern (e.g., value appears exactly 3 times with specific spacing).

**Practice 3:** Create a tuple analyzer that generates statistics: most common element, least common element, elements appearing once.

**Practice 4:** Write a function that replaces nth occurrence of a value by creating a new tuple (remember: tuples are immutable).

**Practice 5:** Implement a function that checks if two tuples have the same frequency distribution of elements using count().
