### Q4: Voting System (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write a program that implements a voting system:

1. Given votes: `votes = ('Alice', 'Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Alice')`

2. Write `count_votes(votes)` that returns a dictionary:
   ```python
   {'Alice': 4, 'Bob': 2, 'Charlie': 1}
   ```

3. Write `find_winner(votes)` that:
   - Returns the candidate with most votes
   - Uses count() to tally votes
   
4. Write `get_vote_positions(votes, candidate)` that:
   - Returns list of indices where candidate received votes
   - Uses index() with start parameter

**Expected Output:**
```
Vote counts: {'Alice': 4, 'Bob': 2, 'Charlie': 1}
Winner: Alice with 4 votes
Alice received votes at positions: [0, 2, 4, 6]
Bob received votes at positions: [1, 5]
Charlie received votes at positions: [3]
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Frequency counting with count()
- Finding maximum using counts
- Position tracking with index()
- Dictionary for results
