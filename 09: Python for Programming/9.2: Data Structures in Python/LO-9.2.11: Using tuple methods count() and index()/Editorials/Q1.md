### Q1 Solution: Basic count() and index() Usage

```python
# 1. Create tuple
numbers = (5, 10, 5, 15, 20, 5, 25)

# 2. Count 5s
count_5 = numbers.count(5)
print(f"Count of 5: {count_5}")

# 3. Find first occurrence of 10
index_10 = numbers.index(10)
print(f"First occurrence of 10 at index: {index_10}")

# 4. Find second occurrence of 5
first_5 = numbers.index(5)  # First at 0
second_5 = numbers.index(5, first_5 + 1)  # Search after first
print(f"Second occurrence of 5 at index: {second_5}")

# 5. Try to find 30 with error handling
try:
    index_30 = numbers.index(30)
    print(f"30 found at index: {index_30}")
except ValueError:
    print("30 not found in tuple")
```

**Key Concepts:**
- count() returns number of occurrences
- index() finds first occurrence
- Use index(value, start) to find next occurrence
- index() raises ValueError if not found - use try-except
