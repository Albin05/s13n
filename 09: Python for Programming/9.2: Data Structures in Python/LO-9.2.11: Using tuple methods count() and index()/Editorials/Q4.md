### Q4 Solution: Voting System

```python
votes = ('Alice', 'Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Alice')

def count_votes(votes):
    """Count votes for each candidate"""
    # Get unique candidates
    candidates = []
    for vote in votes:
        if vote not in candidates:
            candidates.append(vote)
    
    # Count votes for each
    results = {}
    for candidate in candidates:
        results[candidate] = votes.count(candidate)
    
    return results

def find_winner(votes):
    """Find candidate with most votes"""
    vote_counts = count_votes(votes)
    max_votes = max(vote_counts.values())
    
    for candidate, count in vote_counts.items():
        if count == max_votes:
            return candidate, count

def get_vote_positions(votes, candidate):
    """Get all positions where candidate received votes"""
    positions = []
    start = 0
    
    while True:
        try:
            pos = votes.index(candidate, start)
            positions.append(pos)
            start = pos + 1
        except ValueError:
            break
    
    return positions

# Execute
print(f"Vote counts: {count_votes(votes)}")

winner, count = find_winner(votes)
print(f"Winner: {winner} with {count} votes")

# Show positions
for candidate in ('Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'):
    positions = get_vote_positions(votes, candidate)
    print(f"{candidate} received votes at positions: {positions}")
```

**Key Points:**
- count() efficiently tallies votes
- max() finds highest vote count
- index() with loop tracks all vote positions
- Combining methods provides complete analysis
