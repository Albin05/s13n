### Q2 Solution: Tuple Methods and Operations

```python
numbers = (5, 10, 15, 10, 20, 10, 25)

# 1. Count 10s
count_10 = numbers.count(10)
print(f"Count of 10: {count_10}")

# 2. Index of 15
index_15 = numbers.index(15)
print(f"Index of 15: {index_15}")

# 3. Second occurrence of 10
# First at index 1, so start search from index 2
second_10 = numbers.index(10, 2)
print(f"Second occurrence of 10 at index: {second_10}")

# 4. Membership test
has_20 = 20 in numbers
print(f"20 in tuple: {has_20}")

# 5. Sum and length
total = sum(numbers)
length = len(numbers)
print(f"Sum: {total}")
print(f"Length: {length}")
```

**Explanation:**
- `count(value)` - returns number of occurrences
- `index(value)` - returns first occurrence index
- `index(value, start)` - search from start position
- `in` operator for membership testing
- Built-in functions: `sum()`, `len()`

**Only 2 Methods:** Tuples have only `count()` and `index()` - no append, remove, etc.
