### Q5 Solution: Student Records System

```python
students = [
    (101, 'Alice', 20, 'A', 3.8),
    (102, 'Bob', 21, 'B', 3.2),
    (103, 'Charlie', 19, 'A', 3.9),
    (104, 'Diana', 20, 'C', 2.8),
    (105, 'Eve', 22, 'B', 3.5)
]

# 1. Find by ID
def find_by_id(students, student_id):
    for student in students:
        if student[0] == student_id:
            return student
    return None

student_103 = find_by_id(students, 103)
print(f"Student 103: {student_103}")
print()

# 2. Honors students
def get_honors_students(students):
    return [s for s in students if s[4] >= 3.5]

honors = get_honors_students(students)
print("Honors students (GPA ≥ 3.5):")
for student in honors:
    id, name, age, grade, gpa = student  # Unpack
    print(f"  {name}: {gpa}")
print()

# 3. Average GPA
total_gpa = sum(s[4] for s in students)
avg_gpa = total_gpa / len(students)
print(f"Average GPA: {avg_gpa:.2f}")
print()

# 4. ID to name mapping
id_to_name = {s[0]: s[1] for s in students}
print("ID to Name mapping:")
print(f"  {id_to_name}")
print()

# 5. Youngest and oldest
youngest = min(students, key=lambda s: s[2])
oldest = max(students, key=lambda s: s[2])

print(f"Youngest: {youngest[1]} ({youngest[2]} years)")
print(f"Oldest: {oldest[1]} ({oldest[2]} years)")
```

**Explanation:**
- Each record is immutable tuple
- Access by index: `student[0]` for ID, `student[4]` for GPA
- Unpack for readability: `id, name, age, grade, gpa = student`
- Filter with list comprehension
- `min()`/`max()` with key parameter

**Why Tuples:**
- Student records shouldn't be modified
- Fixed structure: always 5 elements
- Can be sorted, compared
- More memory efficient than dicts

**Key Concepts:**
- Tuples for immutable records
- Index access or unpacking
- Functions work with tuples naturally
- Great for fixed-structure data
