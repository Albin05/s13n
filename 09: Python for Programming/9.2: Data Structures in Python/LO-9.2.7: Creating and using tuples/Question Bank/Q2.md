### Q2: Tuple Methods and Operations (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Given `numbers = (5, 10, 15, 10, 20, 10, 25)`:
1. Count how many times 10 appears
2. Find the index of the first occurrence of 15
3. Find the index of the second occurrence of 10 (hint: use start parameter)
4. Check if 20 is in the tuple
5. Calculate the sum and length of the tuple

**Expected Output:**
```
Count of 10: 3
Index of 15: 2
Second occurrence of 10 at index: 3
20 in tuple: True
Sum: 105
Length: 7
```
