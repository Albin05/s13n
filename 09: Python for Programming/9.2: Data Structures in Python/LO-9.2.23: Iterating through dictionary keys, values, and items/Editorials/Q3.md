### Q3 Solution: Word Frequency Report

```python
text = "python is great python is powerful python is easy to learn and python is fun"
words = text.split()

freq = {}
for word in words:
    freq[word] = freq.get(word, 0) + 1

print("Alphabetical:")
for word in sorted(freq):
    print(f"  {word}: {freq[word]}")

print("\nBy frequency:")
for word in sorted(freq, key=freq.get, reverse=True):
    print(f"  {word}: {freq[word]}")

print("\nBar chart:")
max_len = max(len(w) for w in freq)
for word in sorted(freq, key=freq.get, reverse=True):
    print(f"  {word.ljust(max_len)} : {'*' * freq[word]}")
```
