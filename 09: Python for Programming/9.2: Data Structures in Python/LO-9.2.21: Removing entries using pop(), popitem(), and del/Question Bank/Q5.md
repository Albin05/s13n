### Q5: Cache Manager (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Build a simple cache with a maximum size:

```python
cache = {}
max_size = 3
```

Write functions:
1. `cache_set(key, value)` — adds to cache; if full, removes oldest entry first
2. `cache_get(key)` — returns value or `'MISS'`
3. `cache_delete(key)` — removes entry if exists
4. `cache_clear()` — empties cache

Test with this sequence:
- Set a=1, b=2, c=3 (cache full)
- Set d=4 (should evict 'a')
- Get 'a' (should be MISS)
- Get 'b' (should return 2)
- Delete 'c'
- Print cache state

**Key Concepts:** `popitem()` for eviction, `pop()` for deletion, cache pattern
