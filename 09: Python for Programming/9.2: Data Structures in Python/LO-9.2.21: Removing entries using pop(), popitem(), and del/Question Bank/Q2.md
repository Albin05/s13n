### Q2: Safe Key Removal (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

Given a dictionary and a list of keys to remove:
```python
data = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5}
remove_keys = ['b', 'c', 'x', 'y', 'z']
```

Remove all keys from `remove_keys` that exist, without any errors for missing keys. Print which keys were actually removed and which weren't found.

**Expected Output:**
```
Removed: b=2
Removed: c=3
Not found: x
Not found: y
Not found: z
Final: {'a': 1, 'd': 4, 'e': 5}
```

**Key Concepts:** `pop()` with default value
