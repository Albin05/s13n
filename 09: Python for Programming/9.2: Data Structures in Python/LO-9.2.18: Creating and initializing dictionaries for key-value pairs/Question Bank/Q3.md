### Q3: Student Grade Book (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Create a nested dictionary representing a grade book:

```python
# Structure: {student_name: {subject: grade}}
```

1. Create entries for 3 students with 3 subjects each
2. Print each student's grades
3. Calculate and print each student's average grade
4. Find the student with the highest average

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice: {'Math': 92, 'Science': 88, 'English': 95}
Bob: {'Math': 78, 'Science': 85, 'English': 80}
Charlie: {'Math': 95, 'Science': 92, 'English': 88}

Alice average: 91.67
Bob average: 81.00
Charlie average: 91.67
Top student: Alice (or Charlie, tied at 91.67)
```

**Key Concepts:** Nested dictionaries, iteration, calculations
