### Q4: Word Frequency with Comprehension (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Given a paragraph:
```python
text = "python is great and python is fun and learning python is the best way to learn programming and programming is fun"
```

1. Build a word frequency dictionary using a loop
2. Build a dictionary of words that appear more than once (using comprehension)
3. Build a dictionary of word lengths (word → length) for unique words
4. Find the most frequent word

**Expected Output:**
```
Frequencies: {'python': 3, 'is': 4, 'great': 1, 'and': 3, ...}
Repeated words: {'python': 3, 'is': 4, 'and': 3, 'fun': 2, 'programming': 2}
Word lengths: {'python': 6, 'is': 2, 'great': 5, ...}
Most frequent: 'is' (4 times)
```

**Key Concepts:** Building dicts from data, comprehension filtering, `max()`
