### Q4 Solution: Word Frequency with Comprehension

```python
text = "python is great and python is fun and learning python is the best way to learn programming and programming is fun"
words = text.split()

# 1. Frequency dictionary
freq = {}
for word in words:
    freq[word] = freq.get(word, 0) + 1
print(f"Frequencies: {freq}")

# 2. Repeated words (comprehension)
repeated = {w: c for w, c in freq.items() if c > 1}
print(f"Repeated words: {repeated}")

# 3. Word lengths (unique words)
lengths = {w: len(w) for w in set(words)}
print(f"Word lengths: {lengths}")

# 4. Most frequent
most = max(freq, key=freq.get)
print(f"Most frequent: \'{most}\' ({freq[most]} times)")
```

**Explanation:** `.get(word, 0)` returns 0 for new words, avoiding KeyError. Dictionary comprehension with `if c > 1` filters for repeated words. `max()` with `key=freq.get` finds the key with the highest count.
