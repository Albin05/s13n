### Q4 Solution: Efficient Word Filter

```python
stop_words = {'the', 'a', 'an', 'is', 'in', 'it', 'of', 'and', 'to', 'for',
              'on', 'with', 'at', 'by', 'from', 'or', 'but', 'not', 'this', 'that'}

text = "the quick brown fox is in the garden and it is a beautiful day for a walk in the park"

words = text.split()
total = len(words)

# Filter using set membership — O(1) per word
meaningful = [w for w in words if w not in stop_words]
stop_count = total - len(meaningful)

print(f"Total words: {total}")
print(f"Stop words found: {stop_count}")
print(f"Meaningful words: {len(meaningful)}")
print(f"Filtered: {meaningful}")
```

**Explanation:** Each `w not in stop_words` check is O(1) because `stop_words` is a set. If it were a list, each check would be O(n) where n is the number of stop words. For large texts, this difference is significant.
