### Q3: Permission System (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Create a permission checking system:

```python
roles = {
    'viewer': {'read'},
    'editor': {'read', 'write'},
    'admin': {'read', 'write', 'delete', 'manage_users'},
    'superadmin': {'read', 'write', 'delete', 'manage_users', 'system_config'}
}

users = {
    'Alice': 'admin',
    'Bob': 'editor',
    'Charlie': 'viewer'
}
```

Write a function `check_access(username, required_permissions)` that:
1. Gets the user's role and permissions
2. Checks if they have ALL required permissions (subset check)
3. If not, reports which permissions are missing

Test with:
- Alice trying to `{'read', 'delete'}` → Granted
- Bob trying to `{'read', 'write', 'delete'}` → Denied, missing: `{'delete'}`
- Charlie trying to `{'write'}` → Denied, missing: `{'write'}`

**Key Concepts:** Subset checking, difference for missing items
