### Q4: Efficient Word Filter (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Given a large text and a set of stop words, write an efficient word filter:

```python
stop_words = {'the', 'a', 'an', 'is', 'in', 'it', 'of', 'and', 'to', 'for',
              'on', 'with', 'at', 'by', 'from', 'or', 'but', 'not', 'this', 'that'}

text = "the quick brown fox is in the garden and it is a beautiful day for a walk in the park"
```

1. Split text into words
2. Filter out stop words using set membership (O(1) per check)
3. Count total words, stop words found, and meaningful words
4. Print the meaningful words

**Expected Output:**
```
Total words: 19
Stop words found: 10
Meaningful words: 9
Filtered: ['quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'garden', 'beautiful', 'day', 'walk', 'park']
```

**Key Concepts:** O(1) membership testing, filtering with sets
