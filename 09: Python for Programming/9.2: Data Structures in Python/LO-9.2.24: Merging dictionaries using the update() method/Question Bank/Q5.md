### Q5: Inventory Reconciliation (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Two warehouses report their stock:
```python
warehouse_a = {'laptop': 10, 'phone': 25, 'tablet': 8, 'charger': 100}
warehouse_b = {'phone': 15, 'tablet': 12, 'headset': 30, 'cable': 200}
```

Write functions:
1. `total_stock(w1, w2)` — combined stock (sum values for shared items)
2. `only_in_one(w1, w2)` — items available in only one warehouse
3. `rebalance(w1, w2)` — for shared items, calculate transfer needed to equalize stock

**Expected Output:**
```
Total stock: {'laptop': 10, 'phone': 40, 'tablet': 20, 'charger': 100, 'headset': 30, 'cable': 200}
Only in A: {'laptop': 10, 'charger': 100}
Only in B: {'headset': 30, 'cable': 200}
Rebalance: phone: transfer 5 from A to B, tablet: transfer 2 from B to A
```

**Key Concepts:** Custom merge with arithmetic, set operations on keys
