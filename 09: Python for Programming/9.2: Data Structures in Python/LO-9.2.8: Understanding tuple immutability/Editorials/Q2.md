### Q2 Solution: Shallow Immutability

```python
container = (1, 2, [3, 4, 5], 6)

# 1. Try to change container[0]
print("Attempting container[0] = 100:")
try:
    container[0] = 100
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"  TypeError: {e}")

# 2. Try to replace list
print("\nAttempting container[2] = [7, 8, 9]:")
try:
    container[2] = [7, 8, 9]
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"  TypeError: {e}")

# 3. Modify the list inside
print("\nAppending to container[2]:")
container[2].append(6)
print(f"  Success! container[2].append(6) works")
print(f"  Container is now: {container}")

# 4. Modify list element
print("\nModifying container[2][0]:")
container[2][0] = 999
print(f"  Success! container[2][0] = 999 works")
print(f"  Container is now: {container}")

print("\nExplanation: The tuple structure is immutable (cannot reassign elements),")
print("but the mutable objects INSIDE can still be modified.")
```

**Key Concept:**
- Tuple's structure is immutable
- Objects inside can be mutable
- Can modify mutable objects, just can't reassign tuple elements
