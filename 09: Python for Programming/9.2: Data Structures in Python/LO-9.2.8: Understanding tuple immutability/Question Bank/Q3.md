### Q3: Hashability and Dictionary Keys (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Create a coordinate-based game system using tuples as dictionary keys:

1. Create a `game_map` dictionary with these locations:
   - (0, 0): 'Start'
   - (5, 3): 'Enemy'
   - (10, 7): 'Treasure'
   - (3, 9): 'Trap'

2. Write a function `move_player(position, direction)` that:
   - Takes current position tuple and direction ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right')
   - Returns new position tuple
   - up: y+1, down: y-1, left: x-1, right: x+1

3. Start at (0, 0) and move: right, right, up, up, up, right, right, right
4. Print what's at each position along the way
5. Try to use a list [0, 0] as a dictionary key and show the error

**Expected Output:**
```
Game Map created with 4 locations

Starting at (0, 0): Start

Move right to (1, 0): Empty
Move right to (2, 0): Empty
Move up to (2, 1): Empty
Move up to (2, 2): Empty
Move up to (2, 3): Empty
Move right to (3, 3): Empty
Move right to (4, 3): Empty
Move right to (5, 3): Enemy

Path complete! Found: Enemy at (5, 3)

Attempting to use list as key:
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
Lists cannot be dictionary keys because they are mutable.
Tuples work because they are immutable and hashable.
