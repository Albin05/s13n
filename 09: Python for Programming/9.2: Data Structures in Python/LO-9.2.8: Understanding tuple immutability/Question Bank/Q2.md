### Q2: Shallow Immutability (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Given `container = (1, 2, [3, 4, 5], 6)`:
1. Try to change container[0] to 100
2. Try to replace container[2] with [7, 8, 9]
3. Modify the list at container[2] by appending 6
4. Modify the list at container[2] by changing first element to 999
5. Print the final state and explain what happened

**Expected Output:**
```
Attempting container[0] = 100:
  TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

Attempting container[2] = [7, 8, 9]:
  TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

Appending to container[2]:
  Success! container[2].append(6) works
  Container is now: (1, 2, [3, 4, 5, 6], 6)

Modifying container[2][0]:
  Success! container[2][0] = 999 works
  Container is now: (1, 2, [999, 4, 5, 6], 6)

Explanation: The tuple structure is immutable (cannot reassign elements),
but the mutable objects INSIDE can still be modified.
```
