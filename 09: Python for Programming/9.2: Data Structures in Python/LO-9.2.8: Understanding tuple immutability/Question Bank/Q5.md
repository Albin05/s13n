### Q5: Caching with Tuples (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Implement a memoization system using tuples as cache keys:

```python
# Function to compute expensive operation
def expensive_calculation(a, b, c):
    """Simulates expensive computation"""
    result = (a ** 2) + (b ** 3) + (c ** 4)
    return result
```

Create a caching system:
1. Create a `cache` dictionary
2. Write `cached_calculation(a, b, c)` that:
   - Uses (a, b, c) tuple as cache key
   - Returns cached result if exists
   - Otherwise computes, caches, and returns
3. Write `cache_stats()` to show hits and misses
4. Test with these calls and show cache working:
   - (2, 3, 4) - miss
   - (1, 2, 3) - miss
   - (2, 3, 4) - hit!
   - (1, 2, 3) - hit!
   - (5, 6, 7) - miss
5. Try to use [2, 3, 4] as key and explain why it fails

**Expected Output:**
```
Cache initialized

Call cached_calculation(2, 3, 4):
  Cache MISS - computing...
  Result: 287
  Cache now has 1 entry

Call cached_calculation(1, 2, 3):
  Cache MISS - computing...
  Result: 90
  Cache now has 2 entries

Call cached_calculation(2, 3, 4):
  Cache HIT! Returning cached value
  Result: 287
  Cache still has 2 entries

Call cached_calculation(1, 2, 3):
  Cache HIT! Returning cached value
  Result: 90
  Cache still has 2 entries

Call cached_calculation(5, 6, 7):
  Cache MISS - computing...
  Result: 2642
  Cache now has 3 entries

Cache Statistics:
  Total calls: 5
  Cache hits: 2
  Cache misses: 3
  Hit rate: 40.0%

Attempting to use list [2, 3, 4] as cache key:
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'

Explanation: Lists cannot be dictionary keys because:
  1. Lists are mutable (can change)
  2. Mutable objects cannot be hashed
  3. Dictionary keys must be hashable
  4. Tuples are immutable and hashable - perfect for caching!
