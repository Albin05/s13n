### Q1: Testing Immutability (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Given `data = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)`, attempt these operations and explain what happens:
1. Try to change element at index 2 to 999
2. Try to append 60 to the tuple
3. Try to remove 30 from the tuple
4. Create a new tuple by concatenating with (60, 70)
5. Create a new tuple with element at index 2 changed to 999 (using slicing)

**Expected Output:**
```
Attempting data[2] = 999:
  TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

Attempting data.append(60):
  AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'

Attempting data.remove(30):
  AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'remove'

Concatenation: (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70)
Original unchanged: (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

Modified copy: (10, 20, 999, 40, 50)
Original still: (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
```
