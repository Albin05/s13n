### Q4: Student Grade Lookup System (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
You have two parallel lists:
```python
students = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve']
grades = [85, 92, 78, 88, 95]
```

Create a program that:
1. Takes a student name as input
2. Finds their grade
3. Displays their rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. based on position)
4. Shows if they scored above 85

Test with: 'Charlie' and 'Frank'

**Expected Output:**
```
Student: Charlie
Grade: 78
Rank: 3rd
Above 85: No

Student: Frank
Student not found
```

**Category:** Application  
**Prerequisite LOs:** 9.2.1
