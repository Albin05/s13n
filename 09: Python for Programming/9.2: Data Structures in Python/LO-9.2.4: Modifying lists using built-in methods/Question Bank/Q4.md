### Q4: Student Grade Management (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
You have a list of student scores:
```python
scores = [78, 92, 85, 78, 90, 88, 78, 95, 82, 78]
```

Perform these operations:
1. Count how many students scored 78
2. Find the index of the first score of 90
3. Remove the first occurrence of 78
4. Add a new score of 88 to the end
5. Sort scores in descending order
6. Pop the highest score (first element after sorting)
7. Calculate and print:
   - Total number of students
   - Average score (rounded to 1 decimal)
   - Highest remaining score
   - Lowest remaining score

**Expected Output:**
```
Count of 78: 4
Index of first 90: 4
After removing first 78: [92, 85, 78, 90, 88, 78, 95, 82, 78]
After adding 88: [92, 85, 78, 90, 88, 78, 95, 82, 78, 88]
After sorting descending: [95, 92, 90, 88, 88, 85, 82, 78, 78, 78]
Popped highest: 95
Final scores: [92, 90, 88, 88, 85, 82, 78, 78, 78]

Statistics:
Total students: 9
Average score: 84.3
Highest score: 92
Lowest score: 78
```
