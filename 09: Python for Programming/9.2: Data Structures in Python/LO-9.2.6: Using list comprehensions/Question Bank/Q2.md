### Q2: Filtering with Comprehensions (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Given `numbers = [12, 7, 23, 8, 45, 16, 34, 9, 50, 3]`, use list comprehensions to create:
1. List of numbers greater than 20
2. List of numbers divisible by 4
3. List of single-digit numbers
4. List of numbers between 10 and 30 (inclusive)
5. List of odd numbers

**Expected Output:**
```
Greater than 20: [23, 45, 34, 50]
Divisible by 4: [12, 8, 16, 50]
Single digit: [7, 8, 9, 3]
Between 10-30: [12, 23, 16]
Odd numbers: [7, 23, 45, 9, 3]
```

**Category:** Implementation
**Prerequisite LOs:** 9.2.1, 9.2.2, 9.2.3, 9.2.4, 9.2.5
