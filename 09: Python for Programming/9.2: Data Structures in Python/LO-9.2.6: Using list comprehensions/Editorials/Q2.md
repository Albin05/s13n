### Q2 Solution: Filtering with Comprehensions

```python
numbers = [12, 7, 23, 8, 45, 16, 34, 9, 50, 3]

# 1. Greater than 20
greater_20 = [n for n in numbers if n > 20]
print(f"Greater than 20: {greater_20}")

# 2. Divisible by 4
div_by_4 = [n for n in numbers if n % 4 == 0]
print(f"Divisible by 4: {div_by_4}")

# 3. Single digit
single_digit = [n for n in numbers if n < 10]
print(f"Single digit: {single_digit}")

# 4. Between 10-30
between_10_30 = [n for n in numbers if 10 <= n <= 30]
print(f"Between 10-30: {between_10_30}")

# 5. Odd numbers
odds = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 != 0]
print(f"Odd numbers: {odds}")
```

**Explanation:**
- `if n > 20` - simple comparison filter
- `if n % 4 == 0` - modulo filter
- `if n < 10` - range filter
- `if 10 <= n <= 30` - chained comparison
- `if n % 2 != 0` - logical filter

**Key:** Filtering happens AFTER the `for`, BEFORE the comprehension closes
