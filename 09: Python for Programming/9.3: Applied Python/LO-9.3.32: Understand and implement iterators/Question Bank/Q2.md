## Problem 2 (Easy)

**Title:** String Character Iterator

**Problem Statement:**
Create an iterator class called `CharIterator` that iterates through each character in a string. The class should implement the iterator protocol.

**Input Format:**
A string.

**Output Format:**
Iterate through each character one at a time.

**Sample Usage:**
```python
char_iter = CharIterator("Hello")
for char in char_iter:
    print(char, end="-")
```

**Sample Output:**
```
H-e-l-l-o-
```

**Constraints:**
- Implement `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods
- Raise StopIteration when all characters are processed
