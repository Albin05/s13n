## Problem 1 (Easy)

**Title:** Basic Counter Iterator

**Problem Statement:**
Create an iterator class called `CountUp` that counts from a starting number up to (and including) an ending number. The class should implement the iterator protocol with `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.

**Input Format:**
Two integers: start and end values.

**Output Format:**
Iterate through numbers from start to end (inclusive).

**Sample Usage:**
```python
counter = CountUp(1, 5)
for num in counter:
    print(num, end=" ")
```

**Sample Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Constraints:**
- Implement `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods
- Raise StopIteration when done
- start <= end
