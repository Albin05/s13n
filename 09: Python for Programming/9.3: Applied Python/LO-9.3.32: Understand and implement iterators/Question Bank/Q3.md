## Problem 3 (Medium)

**Title:** Skip Iterator

**Problem Statement:**
Create an iterator class called `SkipIterator` that takes a list and a skip value. It should yield every nth element where n is the skip value. For example, with skip=2, it yields elements at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, etc.

**Input Format:**
A list and an integer skip value.

**Output Format:**
Iterate through elements at positions 0, skip, 2*skip, 3*skip, etc.

**Sample Usage:**
```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
skip_iter = SkipIterator(numbers, 3)
for num in skip_iter:
    print(num, end=" ")
```

**Sample Output:**
```
0 3 6 9
```

**Constraints:**
- Implement `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods
- skip >= 1
- Handle cases where skip is larger than list length
