## Problem 4 (Medium)

**Title:** List State Manager

**Problem Statement:**
Create a context manager class called `ListStateManager` that takes a list and saves its state. When entering, it stores the current state. When exiting, it restores the list to that state, effectively undoing any changes made within the with block.

**Input Format:**
A list to manage.

**Output Format:**
List restored to original state on exit.

**Sample Usage:**
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(f"Before: {my_list}")

with ListStateManager(my_list):
    my_list.append(4)
    my_list.append(5)
    print(f"Inside: {my_list}")

print(f"After: {my_list}")
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Before: [1, 2, 3]
Inside: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
After: [1, 2, 3]
```

**Constraints:**
- Implement `__enter__()` and `__exit__()`
- Save and restore list state
- Changes made inside with block are undone
