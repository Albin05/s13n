## Problem 5 (Hard)

**Title:** Transaction Context Manager

**Problem Statement:**
Create a context manager called `Transaction` that simulates a database transaction. It should:
- Start a transaction on enter
- If no errors occur, commit the transaction on exit
- If an error occurs, rollback the transaction
- Track all operations performed

Implement using the contextmanager decorator from contextlib.

**Input Format:**
None (context manager).

**Output Format:**
Print transaction status and operations.

**Sample Usage:**
```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

# Successful transaction
with Transaction() as trans:
    trans.add_operation("INSERT user1")
    trans.add_operation("UPDATE balance")
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Transaction started
Operation: INSERT user1
Operation: UPDATE balance
Transaction committed
```

**Failed Transaction:**
```python
try:
    with Transaction() as trans:
        trans.add_operation("INSERT user2")
        raise ValueError("Error occurred")
        trans.add_operation("This won't execute")
except ValueError:
    pass
```

**Output:**
```
Transaction started
Operation: INSERT user2
Transaction rolled back due to: Error occurred
```

**Constraints:**
- Use @contextmanager decorator
- Track operations in a list
- Print appropriate messages
- Handle exceptions and rollback
