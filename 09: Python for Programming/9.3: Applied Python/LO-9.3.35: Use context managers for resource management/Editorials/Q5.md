## Problem 5: Transaction Context Manager

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def Transaction():
    class TransactionObject:
        def __init__(self):
            self.operations = []

        def add_operation(self, operation):
            print(f"Operation: {operation}")
            self.operations.append(operation)

    trans = TransactionObject()
    print("Transaction started")

    try:
        yield trans
        print("Transaction committed")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Transaction rolled back due to: {e}")
        raise

# Test successful
with Transaction() as trans:
    trans.add_operation("INSERT user1")
    trans.add_operation("UPDATE balance")

# Test failed
try:
    with Transaction() as trans:
        trans.add_operation("INSERT user2")
        raise ValueError("Error occurred")
except ValueError:
    pass
```

### Explanation
Uses @contextmanager decorator. Yields transaction object. Commits on success, rolls back on exception.
