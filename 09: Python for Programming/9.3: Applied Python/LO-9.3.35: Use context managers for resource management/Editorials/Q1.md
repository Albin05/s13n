## Problem 1: Basic File Context Manager

```python
def read_file_safe(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, "r") as file:
            return file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return f"Error: File '{filename}' not found"

# Test
content = read_file_safe("example.txt")
print(content)
```

### Explanation
Uses with statement to ensure file is closed. Try-except handles missing files gracefully.
