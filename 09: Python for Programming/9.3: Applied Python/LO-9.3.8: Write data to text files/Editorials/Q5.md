### Q5 Solution: Safe File Writer

```python
import shutil

def safe_write(filename, content):
    try:
        with open(filename, "x") as f:
            f.write(content)
        return True
    except FileExistsError:
        backup = filename + ".bak"
        shutil.copy2(filename, backup)
        print(f"Backup created: {backup}")
        with open(filename, "w") as f:
            f.write(content)
        return True
```
