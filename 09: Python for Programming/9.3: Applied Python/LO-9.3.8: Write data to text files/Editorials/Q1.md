### Q1 Solution: Basic File Writing

```python
# 1. Using write()
with open("greeting.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello!\n")
    f.write("Welcome to Python.\n")
    f.write("Enjoy coding!\n")

# 2. Using print(file=)
with open("numbers.txt", "w") as f:
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(i, file=f)

# 3. Using writelines()
items = ["Apple\n", "Banana\n", "Cherry\n"]
with open("list.txt", "w") as f:
    f.writelines(items)

# Verify
for fname in ["greeting.txt", "numbers.txt", "list.txt"]:
    with open(fname) as f:
        print(f"--- {fname} ---")
        print(f.read())
```
