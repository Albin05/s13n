### Q2: Student Record Writer (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

Given a list of students:
```python
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 22, "grade": "A"},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 24, "grade": "B"},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 21, "grade": "A+"}
]
```

Write them to "students.txt" in a formatted table:
```
Name       Age  Grade
---------- ---- -----
Alice      22   A
Bob        24   B
Charlie    21   A+
