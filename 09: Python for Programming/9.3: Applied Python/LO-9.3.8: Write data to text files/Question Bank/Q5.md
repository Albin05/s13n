### Q5: Safe File Writer (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write `safe_write(filename, content)` that:
- If file doesn't exist: creates it
- If file exists: asks before overwriting (use "x" mode + fallback)
- Creates a backup of existing file before overwriting
- Returns True if written, False if skipped

**Key Concepts:** "x" mode, FileExistsError, backup pattern
