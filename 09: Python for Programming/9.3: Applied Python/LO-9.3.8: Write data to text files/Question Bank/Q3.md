### Q3: Log Writer (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write a `Logger` class that:
- Opens a log file on creation
- Has `log(level, message)` method that writes timestamped entries
- Has `close()` method
- Uses context manager protocol (`__enter__`/`__exit__`)

Usage:
```python
with Logger("app.log") as log:
    log.log("INFO", "Application started")
    log.log("ERROR", "Connection failed")
```

**Key Concepts:** Class-based file writing, context manager
