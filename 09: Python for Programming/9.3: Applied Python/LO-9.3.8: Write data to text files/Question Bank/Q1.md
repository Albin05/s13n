### Q1: Basic File Writing (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

Write a program that:
1. Creates "greeting.txt" with 3 lines of text using `write()`
2. Creates "numbers.txt" with numbers 1-10 using `print(file=f)`
3. Creates "list.txt" from a list using `writelines()`

Read each file back and verify the contents.

**Key Concepts:** write(), print(file=), writelines()
