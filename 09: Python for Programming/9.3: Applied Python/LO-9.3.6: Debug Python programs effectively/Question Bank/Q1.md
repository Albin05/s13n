### Q1: Read the Traceback (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

Given this traceback, identify: the error type, which line caused it, and what the fix is.

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "app.py", line 10, in <module>
    result = process_data(records)
  File "app.py", line 6, in process_data
    total = sum(scores)
  File "app.py", line 3, in sum_values
    return a + b
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

**Key Concepts:** Traceback reading, error identification
