### Q2: Find the Bug (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

Each function has a bug. Find and fix it:

```python
# Bug 1
def average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers) - 1

# Bug 2
def greet(names):
    for name in names:
    print(f"Hello, {name}")

# Bug 3
def count_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiou"
    count = 0
    for char in text:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
        return count
```

**Key Concepts:** Operator precedence, indentation, early return
