### Q3: Debug with Print (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

This function should return the second largest number but gives wrong results:

```python
def second_largest(numbers):
    largest = numbers[0]
    second = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > largest:
            second = largest
            largest = num
    return second
```

Add print statements to find the bug. Test with `[5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 2]` (should return 8).

**Key Concepts:** Print debugging, logic error detection
