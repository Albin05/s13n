### Q2 Solution: Find the Bug

```python
# Bug 1: Operator precedence — division happens before subtraction
def average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)  # Removed "- 1"
    # Or if intent was len-1: return sum(numbers) / (len(numbers) - 1)

# Bug 2: Missing indentation
def greet(names):
    for name in names:
        print(f"Hello, {name}")  # Indented under for

# Bug 3: return is inside the loop — only checks first char
def count_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiou"
    count = 0
    for char in text:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count  # Dedented — outside the loop
```
