### Q3 Solution: Debug with Print

```python
def second_largest(numbers):
    largest = numbers[0]
    second = numbers[0]  # BUG: if first element IS the largest, second starts wrong
    for num in numbers:
        print(f"  num={num}, largest={largest}, second={second}")
        if num > largest:
            second = largest
            largest = num
        elif num > second and num != largest:  # FIX: need this condition
            second = num
    return second

print(second_largest([5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 2]))  # Should return 8
```

**Bug:** The original doesn't handle numbers between `second` and `largest`. Adding `elif num > second and num != largest` fixes it.
