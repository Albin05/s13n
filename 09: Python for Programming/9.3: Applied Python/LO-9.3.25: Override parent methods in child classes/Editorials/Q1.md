## Problem 1
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Test the classes
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

print(dog.speak())
print(cat.speak())
```

### Explanation
- Method overriding means redefining a parent's method in the child class
- When a child defines a method with the same name as the parent, it replaces the parent's version
- Each child class provides its own implementation of `speak()`
- The method signature (name and parameters) must match the parent's method
- This is polymorphism: same method name, different behavior based on object type
- When we call `speak()`, Python uses the version defined in the actual class of the object
