## Problem 4 (Medium)
Create a base class `Media` with attributes `title` and `duration` (in minutes), and a method `play()` that prints "Playing [title]". Create child classes:
- `Song`: overrides `play()` to show "Playing song: [title] by [artist]" (add artist attribute)
- `Podcast`: overrides `play()` to show "Playing podcast: [title] - Episode [episode_number]" (add episode_number attribute)
- `Video`: overrides `play()` to show "Playing video: [title] in [resolution]" (add resolution attribute)

Create one of each and call their `play()` methods.
