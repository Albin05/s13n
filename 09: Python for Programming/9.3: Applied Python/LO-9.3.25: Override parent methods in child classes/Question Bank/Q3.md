## Problem 3 (Medium)
Create a base class `Account` with attributes `account_number` and `balance`, and a method `withdraw(amount)` that subtracts from balance. Create a child class `SavingsAccount` that overrides `withdraw()` to:
- Prevent withdrawal if balance falls below minimum balance of $100
- Charge a $5 fee if withdrawing below $500
- Allow normal withdrawal otherwise

Test with various withdrawal scenarios.
