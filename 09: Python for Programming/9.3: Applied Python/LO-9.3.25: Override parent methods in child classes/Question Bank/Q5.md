## Problem 5 (Hard)
Create a notification system with class hierarchy:
- Base class `Notification` with attributes `message` and `timestamp`, and methods `send()` and `format_message()`
- `EmailNotification`: overrides `send()` to include email-specific logic (to, subject), and `format_message()` to add email headers
- `SMSNotification`: overrides `send()` to include SMS logic (phone_number, character limit of 160), and `format_message()` to truncate if needed
- `PushNotification`: overrides `send()` to include push notification logic (app_name, priority), and `format_message()` to add app badge

Each child class should handle the notification differently while maintaining the same interface. Demonstrate sending all three types of notifications.
