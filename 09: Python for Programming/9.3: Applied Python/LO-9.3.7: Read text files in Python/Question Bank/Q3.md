### Q3: Log File Analyzer (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Given a log file with lines like:
```
2024-01-15 10:30:00 INFO User logged in
2024-01-15 10:31:00 ERROR Database connection failed
2024-01-15 10:32:00 WARNING Disk space low
2024-01-15 10:33:00 ERROR File not found
```

Write `analyze_log(filename)` that returns:
- Count of each log level (INFO, ERROR, WARNING)
- All ERROR messages
- First and last timestamps

**Key Concepts:** Parsing text, counting, filtering
