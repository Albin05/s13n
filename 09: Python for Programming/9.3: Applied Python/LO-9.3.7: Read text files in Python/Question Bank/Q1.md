### Q1: Basic File Reading (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

Write a program that reads a file "sample.txt" and prints:
1. The entire content using `read()`
2. The number of lines
3. The number of words
4. The number of characters (excluding newlines)

Handle `FileNotFoundError` gracefully.

**Key Concepts:** read(), line/word/char counting
