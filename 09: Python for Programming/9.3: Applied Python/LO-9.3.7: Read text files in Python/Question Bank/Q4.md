### Q4: Config File Reader (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write `read_config(filename)` that reads a config file:
```
# Database settings
host = localhost
port = 5432
database = myapp

# App settings
debug = true
log_level = info
```

Rules: skip empty lines and comments (#). Parse `key = value` pairs into a dictionary. Convert `true`/`false` to booleans and numbers to ints.

**Key Concepts:** Parsing, type conversion, filtering
