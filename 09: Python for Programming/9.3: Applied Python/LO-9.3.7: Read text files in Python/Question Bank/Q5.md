### Q5: File Comparison (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write `compare_files(file1, file2)` that:
- Reads both files
- Reports which lines are identical
- Reports which lines differ (showing both versions)
- Reports lines only in one file (if files have different lengths)
- Returns a summary: same count, different count, only-in-one count

**Key Concepts:** Parallel iteration, file comparison
