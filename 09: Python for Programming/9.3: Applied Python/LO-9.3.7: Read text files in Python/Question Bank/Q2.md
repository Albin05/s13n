### Q2: Line-by-Line Processing (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

Write a function `print_numbered(filename)` that reads a file and prints each line with its line number:

```
1: First line of the file
2: Second line of the file
3: Third line of the file
```

Also print total lines at the end.

**Key Concepts:** enumerate, line iteration
