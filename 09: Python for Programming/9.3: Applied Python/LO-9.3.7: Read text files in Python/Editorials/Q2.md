### Q2 Solution: Line-by-Line Processing

```python
def print_numbered(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename) as f:
            for i, line in enumerate(f, 1):
                print(f"{i}: {line.strip()}")
            print(f"\nTotal: {i} lines")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File '{filename}' not found")

print_numbered("sample.txt")
```
