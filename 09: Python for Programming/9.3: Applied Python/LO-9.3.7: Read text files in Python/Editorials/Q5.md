### Q5 Solution: File Comparison

```python
def compare_files(file1, file2):
    with open(file1) as f1, open(file2) as f2:
        lines1 = f1.readlines()
        lines2 = f2.readlines()
    
    same = diff = only_one = 0
    max_lines = max(len(lines1), len(lines2))
    
    for i in range(max_lines):
        if i < len(lines1) and i < len(lines2):
            if lines1[i] == lines2[i]:
                same += 1
            else:
                diff += 1
                print(f"Line {i+1} differs:")
                print(f"  File1: {lines1[i].strip()}")
                print(f"  File2: {lines2[i].strip()}")
        elif i < len(lines1):
            only_one += 1
            print(f"Line {i+1}: only in {file1}")
        else:
            only_one += 1
            print(f"Line {i+1}: only in {file2}")
    
    print(f"\nSame: {same}, Different: {diff}, Only in one: {only_one}")
```
