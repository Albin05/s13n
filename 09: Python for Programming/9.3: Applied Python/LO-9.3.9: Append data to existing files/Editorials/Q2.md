## Problem 2
```python
# Write initial content
with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Start\n")

# Append middle
with open("file.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("Middle\n")

# Append end
with open("file.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("End\n")

# Read and print
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.read())
```

### Explanation
- First use "w" to create file
- Then use "a" twice to append
- Finally use "r" to read
- File contains all three lines
