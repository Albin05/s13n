## Problem 1
```python
with open("names.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("Alice\n")
    f.write("Bob\n")
    f.write("Charlie\n")
    f.write("David\n")
    f.write("Eve\n")
```

### Explanation
- Open file in append mode "a"
- Write each name with \n for new line
- File closes automatically with `with` statement
