```python
def save_score(name, score):
    with open("scores.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write(f"{name}: {score}\n")

def show_all_scores():
    with open("scores.txt", "r") as f:
        print(f.read())

# Save scores
save_score("Alice", 100)
save_score("Bob", 95)
save_score("Charlie", 110)
save_score("David", 88)
save_score("Eve", 92)

# Display all
show_all_scores()
```
