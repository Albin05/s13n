## Problem 5 (Hard)
Create a comprehensive log system:
- Function `log_message(level, message)` where level is "INFO", "WARNING", or "ERROR"
- Each log entry should have timestamp, level, and message
- Log at least 5 different events
- Create a function `show_errors_only()` that reads the log and displays only ERROR entries

Use the datetime module for timestamps.

Example log entry:
```
[2024-01-15 10:30:45] INFO: Application started
[2024-01-15 10:31:00] WARNING: Low memory
[2024-01-15 10:31:15] ERROR: Connection failed
```
