## Problem 5 (Hard)

**Title:** Nested Dictionary - Character Frequency

**Problem Statement:**
Given a list of words, create a nested dictionary where each word is a key, and its value is another dictionary containing the frequency of each character in that word. Use dictionary comprehension.

**Input Format:**
A list of words is provided.

**Output Format:**
Print the nested dictionary.

**Sample Input:**
```python
words = ["hello", "world", "python"]
```

**Sample Output:**
```
{
    'hello': {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1},
    'world': {'w': 1, 'o': 1, 'r': 1, 'l': 1, 'd': 1},
    'python': {'p': 1, 'y': 1, 't': 1, 'h': 1, 'o': 1, 'n': 1}
}
```

**Constraints:**
- Use nested dictionary comprehension
- Count character frequency for each word
- Maintain alphabetical order of characters (optional)

**Hint:**
You'll need a nested dictionary comprehension: the outer one for words, and the inner one for character frequencies in each word.
