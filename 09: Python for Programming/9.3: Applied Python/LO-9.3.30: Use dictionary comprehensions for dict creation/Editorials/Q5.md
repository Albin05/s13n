## Problem 5: Nested Dictionary - Character Frequency

```python
words = ["hello", "world", "python"]

# Create nested dictionary with character frequencies
char_freq = {
    word: {char: word.count(char) for char in set(word)}
    for word in words
}
print(char_freq)

# Alternative with sorted characters
char_freq_sorted = {
    word: {char: word.count(char) for char in sorted(set(word))}
    for word in words
}
print("\nWith sorted characters:")
print(char_freq_sorted)
```

### Explanation
This uses a nested dictionary comprehension:

1. **Outer comprehension:** `for word in words`
   - Iterates through each word in the list
   - Creates a key for each word

2. **Inner comprehension:** `{char: word.count(char) for char in set(word)}`
   - `set(word)` gets unique characters in the word
   - For each unique character, counts its occurrences using `word.count(char)`
   - Creates a dictionary of character frequencies

For example, for "hello":
- `set("hello")` gives `{'h', 'e', 'l', 'o'}`
- Count each: h=1, e=1, l=2, o=1
- Result: `{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}`

**More efficient solution using Counter:**
```python
from collections import Counter

words = ["hello", "world", "python"]
char_freq = {word: dict(Counter(word)) for word in words}
print(char_freq)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n * m * k) where n is number of words, m is average word length, and k is unique characters per word (due to count operations)
**Space Complexity:** O(n * k) for the nested dictionary

**Note:** The `count()` method scans the entire string for each character, which is inefficient. Using `Counter` is more efficient as it scans the string only once.
