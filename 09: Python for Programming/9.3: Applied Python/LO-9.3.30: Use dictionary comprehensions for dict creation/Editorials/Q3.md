## Problem 3: Filter Products by Price

```python
products = {
    "laptop": 999,
    "mouse": 25,
    "keyboard": 75,
    "monitor": 299,
    "cable": 15,
    "headphones": 89
}

# Filter products with price > 50
expensive = {product: price for product, price in products.items() if price > 50}
print(expensive)
```

### Explanation
The dictionary comprehension iterates through `products.items()` which returns tuples of (key, value). The condition `if price > 50` filters only products with price greater than 50. The result is a new dictionary with only those products.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of products
**Space Complexity:** O(k) where k is the number of products matching the condition
