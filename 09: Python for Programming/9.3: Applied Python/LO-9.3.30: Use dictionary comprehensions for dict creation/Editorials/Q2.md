## Problem 2: Name and Age Mapping

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"]
ages = [25, 30, 35, 28]

# Create dictionary mapping names to ages
people = {name: age for name, age in zip(names, ages)}
print(people)
```

### Explanation
The `zip(names, ages)` function pairs each name with its corresponding age. The dictionary comprehension then creates key-value pairs from these tuples. The unpacking `name, age` extracts elements from each tuple.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the lists
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the output dictionary
