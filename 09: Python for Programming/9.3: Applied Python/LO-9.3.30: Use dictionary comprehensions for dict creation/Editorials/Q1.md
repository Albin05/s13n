## Problem 1: Number Squares Dictionary

```python
# Create dictionary with numbers 1-10 and their squares
squares = {i: i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11)}
print(squares)
```

### Explanation
The dictionary comprehension iterates through numbers 1 to 10 (inclusive) using `range(1, 11)`. For each number `i`, it creates a key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `i ** 2` (the square).

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is 10
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the output dictionary
