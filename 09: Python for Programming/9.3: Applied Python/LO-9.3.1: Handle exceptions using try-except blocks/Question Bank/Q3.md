### Q3: File Data Processor (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write a function `process_numbers(filename)` that:
- Reads a file where each line contains a number
- Converts each line to a float
- Skips lines that can't be converted (catch `ValueError`)
- Returns a tuple: (valid_numbers_list, skipped_count)
- Handles `FileNotFoundError` if file doesn't exist

Test with a file containing: `10`, `20.5`, `hello`, `30`, ``, `forty`, `50`

**Expected Output:**
```
Valid numbers: [10.0, 20.5, 30.0, 50.0]
Skipped: 3 lines
```

**Key Concepts:** try-except in loops, multiple exception handling
