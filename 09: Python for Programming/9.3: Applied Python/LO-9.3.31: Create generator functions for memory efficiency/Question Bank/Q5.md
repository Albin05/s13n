## Problem 5 (Hard)

**Title:** Prime Number Generator with Limit

**Problem Statement:**
Create a generator function `prime_generator(limit)` that yields prime numbers up to and including the limit. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Input Format:**
An integer limit.

**Output Format:**
Yield all prime numbers up to and including the limit.

**Sample Input:**
```python
for prime in prime_generator(30):
    print(prime, end=" ")
```

**Sample Output:**
```
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29
```

**Constraints:**
- Use yield keyword
- limit >= 2
- Yield primes in ascending order
- Include the limit if it's prime

**Hint:**
Create a helper function to check if a number is prime. A number n is prime if it's not divisible by any number from 2 to sqrt(n).
