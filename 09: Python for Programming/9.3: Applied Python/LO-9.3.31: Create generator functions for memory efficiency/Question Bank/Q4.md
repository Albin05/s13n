## Problem 4 (Medium)

**Title:** Batch Data Generator

**Problem Statement:**
Create a generator function `batch_data(items, batch_size)` that takes a list and yields items in batches of the specified size. The last batch may have fewer items if the list length is not evenly divisible by batch_size.

**Input Format:**
A list of items and an integer batch_size.

**Output Format:**
Yield lists (batches) of the specified size.

**Sample Input:**
```python
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
for batch in batch_data(data, 3):
    print(batch)
```

**Sample Output:**
```
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]
[10]
```

**Constraints:**
- Use yield keyword
- batch_size >= 1
- Handle remaining items in final batch
