## Problem 2: Countdown Generator

```python
def countdown(n):
    """Generator that counts down from n to 1"""
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

# Test
for num in countdown(5):
    print(num, end=" ")
# Output: 5 4 3 2 1
```

### Explanation
The generator uses a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than 0. Each iteration yields the current value of n, then decrements it. The loop stops when n reaches 0.

**Alternative solution using range:**
```python
def countdown(n):
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        yield i
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - generator uses constant memory
