## Problem 1: Simple Number Generator

```python
def generate_evens(n):
    """Generator that yields even numbers from 0 to n"""
    for i in range(0, n + 1, 2):
        yield i

# Test
for num in generate_evens(10):
    print(num, end=" ")
# Output: 0 2 4 6 8 10
```

### Explanation
The generator uses `range(0, n + 1, 2)` to iterate through even numbers. The step of 2 ensures we only get even numbers. The `yield` keyword returns each number one at a time without storing all values in memory.

**Alternative solution:**
```python
def generate_evens(n):
    current = 0
    while current <= n:
        yield current
        current += 2
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n/2) = O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - generator uses constant memory
