## Problem 4: Batch Data Generator

```python
def batch_data(items, batch_size):
    """Generator that yields items in batches"""
    batch = []

    for item in items:
        batch.append(item)
        if len(batch) == batch_size:
            yield batch
            batch = []

    # Yield remaining items if any
    if batch:
        yield batch

# Test
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
for batch in batch_data(data, 3):
    print(batch)
# Output:
# [1, 2, 3]
# [4, 5, 6]
# [7, 8, 9]
# [10]
```

### Explanation
1. Initialize an empty batch list
2. Iterate through each item in the input items
3. Add each item to the current batch
4. When the batch reaches the specified size, yield it and reset to empty list
5. After the loop, check if there are remaining items in the batch
6. If yes, yield the final (possibly incomplete) batch

**Alternative solution using slicing:**
```python
def batch_data(items, batch_size):
    for i in range(0, len(items), batch_size):
        yield items[i:i + batch_size]
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of items
**Space Complexity:** O(batch_size) for storing each batch
