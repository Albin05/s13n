## Problem 3: Fibonacci Generator

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Generator that yields first n Fibonacci numbers"""
    a, b = 0, 1
    count = 0

    while count < n:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
        count += 1

# Test
for num in fibonacci(8):
    print(num, end=" ")
# Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
```

### Explanation
1. Initialize `a` and `b` to the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1)
2. Use a counter to track how many numbers have been generated
3. Yield the current value of `a`
4. Update `a` and `b` using simultaneous assignment: `a` becomes `b`, and `b` becomes `a + b`
5. Increment the counter
6. Continue until n numbers have been yielded

**How the update works:**
- Initially: a=0, b=1
- After 1st yield: a=1, b=1 (0+1)
- After 2nd yield: a=1, b=2 (1+1)
- After 3rd yield: a=2, b=3 (1+2)
- And so on...

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - only stores two numbers at a time
