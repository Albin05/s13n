## Problem 5 (Hard)
Create a logging system with method chaining using super():
- Base class `Logger` with method `log(message)` that prints with timestamp
- `FileLogger` inherits from Logger, overrides `log()` to call `super().log()` first, then writes to file
- `EmailLogger` inherits from FileLogger, overrides `log()` to call `super().log()` first, then sends email
- `AlertLogger` inherits from EmailLogger, overrides `log()` for critical messages to call `super().log()` first, then triggers alert

Create an AlertLogger and demonstrate how a single log call cascades through all parent implementations using super(). Show the execution order.
