## Problem 3 (Medium)
Create a base class `BankAccount` with attributes `account_number` and `balance`, and a method `deposit(amount)`. Create a child class `InterestAccount` that adds an `interest_rate` attribute and overrides `deposit()` to:
- Call parent's `deposit()` using `super()`
- Calculate and add interest on the deposited amount
- Print the interest earned

Test with multiple deposits.
