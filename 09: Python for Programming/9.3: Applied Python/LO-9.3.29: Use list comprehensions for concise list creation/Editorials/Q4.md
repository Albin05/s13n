## Problem 4: Word Length Filter

```python
import string

sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!"

# Split into words, remove punctuation, lowercase, and filter by length
words = sentence.split()
filtered_words = [word.strip(string.punctuation).lower() for word in words
                  if len(word.strip(string.punctuation)) > 4]
print(filtered_words)
```

### Explanation
1. Split the sentence into words using `split()`
2. For each word, strip punctuation using `strip(string.punctuation)`
3. Convert to lowercase with `.lower()`
4. Filter to include only words with length > 4
5. The condition checks length after stripping punctuation

**Alternative approach:**
```python
import string

sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!"
words = sentence.split()
cleaned = [word.strip(string.punctuation).lower() for word in words]
filtered_words = [word for word in cleaned if len(word) > 4]
print(filtered_words)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n*m) where n is number of words and m is average word length
**Space Complexity:** O(k) where k is the number of filtered words
