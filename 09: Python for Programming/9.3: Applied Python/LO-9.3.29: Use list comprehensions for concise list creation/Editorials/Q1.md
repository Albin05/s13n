## Problem 1: Square Numbers

```python
# Create list of squares from 1 to 10
squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11)]
print(squares)
```

### Explanation
This list comprehension iterates through numbers 1 to 10 (inclusive) and squares each number. The expression `i ** 2` is applied to each value of `i` from `range(1, 11)`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is 10
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the output list
