## Problem 2: Extract Even Numbers

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

# Extract only even numbers
evens = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]
print(evens)
```

### Explanation
The list comprehension filters the numbers list by including only those where `n % 2 == 0` (even numbers). The condition `if n % 2 == 0` acts as a filter.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of numbers
**Space Complexity:** O(k) where k is the number of even numbers
