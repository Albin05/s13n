## Problem 5 (Hard)

**Title:** Matrix Diagonal Sum

**Problem Statement:**
Create a 5x5 matrix where each element at position (i, j) equals i + j using nested list comprehension. Then calculate and print the sum of the main diagonal elements (where i == j).

**Input Format:**
No input required.

**Output Format:**
First print the matrix (each row on a new line), then print the diagonal sum.

**Sample Output:**
```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Diagonal sum: 20
```

**Constraints:**
- Use nested list comprehension to create matrix
- Matrix must be 5x5
- Calculate sum of diagonal where i == j
- Elements should be i + j

**Hint:**
The diagonal elements are at positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4).
