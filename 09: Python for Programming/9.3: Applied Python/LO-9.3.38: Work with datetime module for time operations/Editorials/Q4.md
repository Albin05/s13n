## Problem 4: Business Days Calculator

```python
from datetime import date, timedelta

def count_business_days(start_date, end_date):
    count = 0
    current = start_date

    while current <= end_date:
        # weekday() returns 0-6, where 5=Saturday, 6=Sunday
        if current.weekday() < 5:  # Monday-Friday
            count += 1
        current += timedelta(days=1)

    return count

# Test
start = date(2024, 12, 1)
end = date(2024, 12, 7)
count = count_business_days(start, end)
print(f"Business days: {count}")
```

### Explanation
Iterate through each day from start to end. Count days where weekday() returns 0-4 (Monday-Friday). Skip weekends (5-6).
