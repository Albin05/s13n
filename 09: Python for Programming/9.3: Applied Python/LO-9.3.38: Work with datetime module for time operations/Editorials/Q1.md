## Problem 1: Days Until Event

```python
from datetime import date

def days_until(target_date):
    today = date.today()
    diff = target_date - today
    return diff.days

# Test
new_year = date(2025, 1, 1)
days = days_until(new_year)
print(f"Days until New Year: {days}")
```

### Explanation
Subtract today's date from target date to get timedelta, then access days attribute.
