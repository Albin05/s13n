## Problem 3: Age Calculator

```python
from datetime import date

def calculate_age(birth_date):
    today = date.today()
    age = today.year - birth_date.year

    # Adjust if birthday hasn't occurred this year
    if (today.month, today.day) < (birth_date.month, birth_date.day):
        age -= 1

    return age

# Test
birthday = date(1990, 5, 15)
age = calculate_age(birthday)
print(f"Age: {age}")
```

### Explanation
Calculate initial age by year difference. Subtract 1 if birthday hasn't occurred this year by comparing month and day tuples.
