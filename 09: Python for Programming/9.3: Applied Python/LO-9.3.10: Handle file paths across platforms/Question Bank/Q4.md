### Q4: Path Resolver (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write `resolve_path(path_string)` that:
- Converts string to Path
- Resolves to absolute path
- Expands `~` to home directory
- Checks if path exists and what type (file/dir/neither)
- Returns dict with path info

**Key Concepts:** resolve(), expanduser(), exists(), is_file()
