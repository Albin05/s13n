### Q2 Solution: File Cleanup

```python
def read_first_line(filename):
    f = None
    try:
        f = open(filename)
        return f.readline().strip()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File '{filename}' not found")
        return None
    finally:
        if f is not None:
            f.close()
            print(f"File closed")

result = read_first_line("data.txt")
```

**Explanation:** We initialize `f = None` before try so finally can check if the file was opened. If `open()` fails with FileNotFoundError, `f` stays None and we skip `f.close()`.
