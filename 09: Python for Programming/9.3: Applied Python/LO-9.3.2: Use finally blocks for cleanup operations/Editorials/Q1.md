### Q1 Solution: Basic Finally Behavior

```python
# Block A — no error
try:
    print("A1")
    x = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("A2")
finally:
    print("A3")
# Output: A1, A3

# Block B — error caught
try:
    print("B1")
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("B2")
finally:
    print("B3")
# Output: B1, B2, B3

# Block C — error NOT caught
try:
    try:
        print("C1")
        x = int("abc")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("C2")
    finally:
        print("C3")
except ValueError:
    print("ValueError propagated")
# Output: C1, C3, ValueError propagated
```

**Explanation:** Block A: no error, so except is skipped but finally runs. Block B: error is caught AND finally runs. Block C: ValueError is not caught by ZeroDivisionError handler, but finally STILL runs before the error propagates.
