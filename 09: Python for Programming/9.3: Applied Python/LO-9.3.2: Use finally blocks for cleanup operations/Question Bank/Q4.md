### Q4: Transaction Handler (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write a function `transfer_money(accounts, from_acc, to_acc, amount)` that:
- Logs "Transaction started"
- Deducts from source, adds to destination
- Raises `ValueError` if insufficient funds
- Uses finally to always log "Transaction ended"
- On error, rolls back the deduction

```python
accounts = {'Alice': 1000, 'Bob': 500}
```

Test with valid transfer (Alice→Bob $200) and invalid (Bob→Alice $1000).

**Key Concepts:** finally for transaction logging, rollback pattern
