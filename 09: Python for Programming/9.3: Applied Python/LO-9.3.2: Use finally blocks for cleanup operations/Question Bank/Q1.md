### Q1: Basic Finally Behavior (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

What is the output of each block? Predict, then verify:

```python
# Block A
try:
    print("A1")
    x = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("A2")
finally:
    print("A3")

# Block B
try:
    print("B1")
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("B2")
finally:
    print("B3")

# Block C
try:
    print("C1")
    x = int("abc")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("C2")
finally:
    print("C3")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
A1, A3 (no error)
B1, B2, B3 (error caught)
C1, C3 then ValueError crashes (error NOT caught, but finally still runs)
```

**Key Concepts:** finally always runs
