### Q5: Resource Manager (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

Write a class `Timer` that tracks execution time:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def start(self): ...
    def stop(self): ...
    def elapsed(self): ...
```

Use it with try-finally to ensure `stop()` is always called:

```python
timer = Timer()
try:
    timer.start()
    # some operation
    result = sum(range(1000000))
finally:
    timer.stop()
    print(f"Elapsed: {timer.elapsed():.4f}s")
```

**Key Concepts:** finally for timing/cleanup, class usage
