## Problem 2
```python
class Address:
    def __init__(self, street, city, zipcode):
        self.street = street
        self.city = city
        self.zipcode = zipcode

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, address):
        self.name = name
        self.address = address

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}")
        print(f"Address: {self.address.street}, {self.address.city} {self.address.zipcode}")

# Test the classes
address = Address("123 Main St", "Springfield", "12345")
person = Person("John Doe", address)
person.display_info()

# Can also create inline
person2 = Person("Jane Smith", Address("456 Oak Ave", "Riverside", "67890"))
person2.display_info()
```

### Explanation
- A `Person` object contains an `Address` object as an attribute
- This models the real-world relationship: a person has an address
- We can access address details through `self.address.street`, `self.address.city`, etc.
- The `Address` object can be created separately or inline during Person creation
- Multiple persons can share the same address object if needed
- This separates concerns: Address handles location data, Person handles personal data
- Composition makes the code modular and reusable
