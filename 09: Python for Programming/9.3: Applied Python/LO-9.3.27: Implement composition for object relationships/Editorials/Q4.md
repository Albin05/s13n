## Problem 4
```python
class CPU:
    def __init__(self, brand, speed, cores):
        self.brand = brand
        self.speed = speed
        self.cores = cores

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.brand} {self.speed}GHz, {self.cores} cores"

class RAM:
    def __init__(self, size, type):
        self.size = size
        self.type = type

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.size}GB {self.type}"

class Storage:
    def __init__(self, capacity, type):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.type = type

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.capacity}GB {self.type}"

class Computer:
    def __init__(self, brand, cpu, ram, storage):
        self.brand = brand
        self.cpu = cpu
        self.ram = ram
        self.storage = storage

    def get_specs(self):
        specs = f"""
=== {self.brand} Computer Specifications ===
CPU: {self.cpu}
RAM: {self.ram}
Storage: {self.storage}
"""
        return specs

# Test the system
cpu = CPU("Intel Core i7", 3.5, 8)
ram = RAM(16, "DDR4")
storage = Storage(512, "SSD")

computer = Computer("Dell XPS", cpu, ram, storage)
print(computer.get_specs())

# Create another computer with different components
computer2 = Computer(
    "HP Pavilion",
    CPU("AMD Ryzen 5", 3.2, 6),
    RAM(8, "DDR4"),
    Storage(1000, "HDD")
)
print(computer2.get_specs())
```

### Explanation
- `Computer` is composed of multiple component objects (CPU, RAM, Storage)
- This models real-world composition: a computer is made up of these parts
- Each component is a separate class with its own attributes and behavior
- Components can be mixed and matched to create different configurations
- The `__str__` methods make components easy to display
- This is strong composition: components are meaningful as part of the computer
- Each component class is independent and reusable
- Multiple computers can use the same component types with different values
