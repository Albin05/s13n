## Problem 1
```python
class Engine:
    def __init__(self, horsepower, type):
        self.horsepower = horsepower
        self.type = type

class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model, engine):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
        self.engine = engine

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}")
        print(f"Engine: {self.engine.horsepower}hp, {self.engine.type}")

# Test the classes
engine = Engine(200, "V6")
car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", engine)
car.display_info()
```

### Explanation
- Composition means one class contains an instance of another class
- The `Car` class HAS-AN `Engine` (not IS-AN Engine like inheritance)
- We create an `Engine` object first, then pass it to the `Car` constructor
- The car can access engine properties through `self.engine.horsepower`
- This represents a "whole-part" relationship: a car is made up of an engine
- Composition is more flexible than inheritance for HAS-A relationships
- If the engine is destroyed, it doesn't affect the Engine class definition
