## Problem 5 (Hard)
Create a university course enrollment system using composition:
- `Student` class with `name`, `student_id`, and list of enrolled courses
- `Professor` class with `name`, `employee_id`, and `department`
- `Course` class with `course_code`, `name`, `professor` (Professor object), and list of enrolled students (Student objects)
- `Department` class with `name` and list of courses

Implement methods:
- `Course.enroll_student(student)`: adds student to course and course to student
- `Course.get_enrollment_count()`: returns number of enrolled students
- `Department.add_course(course)`: adds course to department
- `Department.get_total_enrollment()`: returns total students across all courses

Create a department, add 2 courses with professors, enroll students in courses, and display enrollment statistics.
