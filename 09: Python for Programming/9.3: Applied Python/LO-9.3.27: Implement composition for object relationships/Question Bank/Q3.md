## Problem 3 (Medium)
Create a library system using composition:
- `Book` class with attributes `title`, `author`, `isbn`
- `Library` class that contains a list of `Book` objects
- Add methods to Library: `add_book(book)`, `remove_book(isbn)`, `find_book(title)`, `list_all_books()`

Create a library, add 3 books, find one by title, remove one by ISBN, and list all remaining books.
