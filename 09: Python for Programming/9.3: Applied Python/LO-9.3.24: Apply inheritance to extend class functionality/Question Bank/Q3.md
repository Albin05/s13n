## Problem 3 (Medium)
Create a base class `Employee` with attributes `name`, `id`, and `salary`. Add a method `get_details()` that returns formatted employee information. Create two child classes:
- `Manager`: adds attribute `department` and includes it in details
- `Developer`: adds attribute `programming_language` and includes it in details

Create one manager and one developer, and print their details.
