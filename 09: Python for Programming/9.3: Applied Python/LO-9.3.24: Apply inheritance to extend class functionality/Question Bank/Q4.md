## Problem 4 (Medium)
Create a base class `Shape` with a method `area()` that returns 0. Create child classes:
- `Circle`: has attribute `radius` and calculates area using πr²
- `Square`: has attribute `side` and calculates area using side²
- `Triangle`: has attributes `base` and `height` and calculates area using ½ × base × height

Create one of each shape and print their areas. Use `import math` for π.
