## Problem 5 (Hard)
Create a class hierarchy for a school system:
- Base class `Person` with attributes `name`, `age`, and method `introduce()`
- `Student` inherits from `Person`, adds `student_id` and `grades` (list), and methods `add_grade(grade)` and `get_gpa()`
- `Teacher` inherits from `Person`, adds `employee_id`, `subject`, and `years_experience`
- `TeachingAssistant` inherits from `Student`, adds `subject_taught` and `hours_per_week`

Create instances of all three types and demonstrate their functionality, showing that `TeachingAssistant` has both student and teaching capabilities.
