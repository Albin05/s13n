## Problem 2
```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, num_doors):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
        self.num_doors = num_doors

# Test the class
car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 4)
print(f"Brand: {car.brand}")
print(f"Model: {car.model}")
print(f"Doors: {car.num_doors}")
```

### Explanation
- The child class can add new attributes beyond what the parent has
- `Car.__init__()` takes additional parameters (`num_doors`)
- We manually set `brand` and `model` in the child's `__init__`
- This extends the parent class by adding new functionality
- The child class can accept more parameters than the parent
- Note: This approach repeats code; using `super()` is better (covered in later LO)
