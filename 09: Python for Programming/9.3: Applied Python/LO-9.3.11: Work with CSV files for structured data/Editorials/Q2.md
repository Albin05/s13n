## Problem 2
```python
import csv

students = [
    ["Alice", 20, "A"],
    ["Bob", 21, "B"],
    ["Charlie", 19, "A"]
]

with open("students.csv", "w", newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)

    # Write header
    writer.writerow(["name", "age", "grade"])

    # Write student data
    writer.writerows(students)
```

### Explanation
- We create a list of student data (each student is a list)
- Use `csv.writer()` to create a writer object
- `writerow()` writes the header
- `writerows()` writes all student data at once
- **Important**: Always use `newline=''` when opening files for writing
