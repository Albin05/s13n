## Problem 4
```python
import csv

employees = [
    {"name": "Alice", "department": "Engineering", "salary": 80000},
    {"name": "Bob", "department": "Marketing", "salary": 65000},
    {"name": "Charlie", "department": "Engineering", "salary": 75000}
]

with open("employees.csv", "w", newline='') as file:
    fieldnames = ["name", "department", "salary"]
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    writer.writeheader()  # Write column headers
    writer.writerows(employees)  # Write all employee data
```

### Explanation
- `csv.DictWriter` is perfect for writing dictionaries
- We specify the `fieldnames` to define the column order
- `writeheader()` writes the column names as the first row
- `writerows()` writes all dictionaries at once
- Each dictionary key must match the fieldnames
