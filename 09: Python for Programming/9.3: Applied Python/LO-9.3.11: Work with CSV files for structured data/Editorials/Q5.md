## Problem 5
```python
import csv

total_revenue = 0
max_revenue = 0
top_product = ""

with open("sales.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)

    print("Product Revenues:")
    for row in reader:
        product = row["product"]
        quantity = int(row["quantity"])
        price = int(row["price"])

        revenue = quantity * price
        print(f"{product}: ${revenue}")

        total_revenue += revenue

        if revenue > max_revenue:
            max_revenue = revenue
            top_product = product

print(f"\nTop product: {top_product} (${max_revenue})")
print(f"Total revenue: ${total_revenue}")
```

### Explanation
- Use `DictReader` for easy access to columns by name
- For each product, calculate revenue = quantity × price
- Track the maximum revenue and corresponding product
- Accumulate total revenue across all products
- Convert string values to integers before calculation

**Key Concepts**:
1. **Type conversion**: CSV values are always strings, must convert to int/float
2. **Tracking maximum**: Compare each value and update if larger
3. **Accumulation**: Add to running total in each iteration
4. **DictReader**: Makes code more readable when working with many columns
