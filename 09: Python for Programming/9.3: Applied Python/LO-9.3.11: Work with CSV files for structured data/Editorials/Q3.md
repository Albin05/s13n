## Problem 3
```python
import csv

total = 0
count = 0

with open("scores.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    next(reader)  # Skip header

    for row in reader:
        name, score = row
        total += int(score)  # Convert string to int
        count += 1

average = total / count
print(f"Average score: {average:.2f}")
```

### Explanation
- Initialize variables to track total and count
- Read each row and convert the score to an integer
- Add to total and increment count
- Calculate average by dividing total by count
- Use `.2f` to format the output to 2 decimal places

**Alternative using DictReader**:
```python
import csv

total = 0
count = 0

with open("scores.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)

    for row in reader:
        total += int(row["score"])
        count += 1

average = total / count
print(f"Average score: {average:.2f}")
```
