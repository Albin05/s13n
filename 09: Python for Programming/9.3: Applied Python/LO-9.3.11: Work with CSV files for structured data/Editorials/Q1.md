## Problem 1
```python
import csv

with open("products.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    next(reader)  # Skip header

    for row in reader:
        product, price = row
        print(f"{product}: ${price}")
```

### Explanation
- We use `csv.reader()` to read the file
- `next(reader)` skips the header row
- We unpack each row into `product` and `price` variables
- Then print them in a formatted string
