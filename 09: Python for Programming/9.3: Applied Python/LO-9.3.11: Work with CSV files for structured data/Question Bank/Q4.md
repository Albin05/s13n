## Problem 4 (Medium)
You have a list of dictionaries representing employees:
```python
employees = [
    {"name": "Alice", "department": "Engineering", "salary": 80000},
    {"name": "Bob", "department": "Marketing", "salary": 65000},
    {"name": "Charlie", "department": "Engineering", "salary": 75000}
]
```
Write this data to a CSV file named `employees.csv` using `csv.DictWriter`.
