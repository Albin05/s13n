## Problem 5 (Hard)
Read a CSV file named `sales.csv` with columns `product`, `quantity`, and `price`:
```
product,quantity,price
Laptop,5,999
Mouse,50,25
Keyboard,20,75
Monitor,10,300
```
Calculate and print:
1. The total revenue for each product (quantity × price)
2. The product that generated the most revenue
3. The total revenue from all products

**Hint**: Use `csv.DictReader` to read the file and keep track of the maximum revenue.
