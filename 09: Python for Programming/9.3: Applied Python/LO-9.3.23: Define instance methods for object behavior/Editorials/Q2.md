## Problem 2
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        self.balance -= amount
        print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")

# Test the class
account = BankAccount()
account.deposit(100)
account.withdraw(30)
print(f"Final balance: ${account.balance}")
```

### Explanation
- Instance methods can modify the object's state through `self`
- Both `deposit()` and `withdraw()` take a parameter and use it to update `self.balance`
- Methods can perform actions (printing) and modify attributes
- The balance persists between method calls because it's stored in the instance
- This demonstrates encapsulating behavior with data in a single class
