## Problem 1
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

# Test the class
rect = Rectangle(5, 3)
print(f"Area: {rect.area()}")
```

### Explanation
- Instance methods are functions defined inside a class that operate on instance data
- The `area()` method uses `self` to access the instance's `length` and `width` attributes
- `self` is automatically passed as the first parameter when calling instance methods
- We call the method using `rect.area()`, which returns the calculated area
- Instance methods can access and modify the object's state through `self`
