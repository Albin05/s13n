## Problem 4 (Medium)
Create a class `ShoppingCart` with an attribute `items` (a list of dictionaries with keys "name" and "price"). Define these instance methods:
- `add_item(name, price)`: adds an item to the cart
- `remove_item(name)`: removes the first item with that name
- `get_total()`: returns the total price of all items
- `display_cart()`: prints all items with their prices

Test by adding 3 items, removing 1, and displaying the cart with total.
