## Problem 3 (Medium)

**Title:** Execution Time Decorator

**Problem Statement:**
Create a decorator called `time_it` that measures and prints how long a function takes to execute in seconds.

**Input Format:**
Apply decorator to any function.

**Output Format:**
Print execution time in seconds with 4 decimal places.

**Sample Usage:**
```python
import time

@time_it
def slow_function():
    time.sleep(1)
    return "Done"

result = slow_function()
```

**Sample Output:**
```
slow_function executed in 1.0001 seconds
```

**Constraints:**
- Use the time module
- Print time with 4 decimal places
- Return the original function result

**Hint:**
Use `time.time()` before and after function execution, then calculate the difference.
