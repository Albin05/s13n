## Problem 1 (Easy)
Create a class `BankAccount` with a private attribute `__balance` (using double underscore). Provide public methods `deposit(amount)`, `withdraw(amount)`, and `get_balance()` to access and modify the balance. The balance should not be directly accessible from outside the class. Test by trying to access `__balance` directly and through methods.
