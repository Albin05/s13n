## Problem 5 (Hard)
Create a banking system with proper encapsulation:
- `Account` class with private `__account_number`, `__balance`, `__transaction_history` (list)
- Public methods: `deposit(amount)`, `withdraw(amount)`, `get_balance()`, `get_statement()`
- Private method `__record_transaction(type, amount)` to log transactions
- `SavingsAccount` subclass with private `__interest_rate` and method `apply_interest()`
- Ensure no direct access to private attributes, all operations go through methods
- Transaction history should record type (deposit/withdraw/interest), amount, and timestamp

Create accounts, perform transactions, apply interest, and print statements showing proper encapsulation in action.
