## Problem 4 (Medium)
Create a class `Rectangle` with private attributes `__length` and `__width`. Implement:
- Property getters and setters using `@property` and `@attribute.setter` decorators
- Setters should validate that dimensions are positive
- Add a read-only property `area` (no setter) that calculates area
- Add a read-only property `perimeter` that calculates perimeter

Test by setting dimensions and accessing calculated properties.
