## Problem 3
```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, username, password):
        self.__username = username
        self.__password = password

    def get_username(self):
        return self.__username

    def set_password(self, old_password, new_password):
        if self.__password == old_password:
            self.__password = new_password
            print("Password changed successfully")
            return True
        else:
            print("Incorrect old password")
            return False

    def verify_password(self, password):
        return self.__password == password

# Test the class
user = User("alice", "password123")

print(f"Username: {user.get_username()}")

# Try to access password directly
print("\nTrying to access password directly:")
try:
    print(user.__password)
except AttributeError as e:
    print("Cannot access password directly (good!)")

# Verify password
print("\nVerifying correct password:")
print(f"Is 'password123' correct? {user.verify_password('password123')}")

print("\nVerifying incorrect password:")
print(f"Is 'wrong' correct? {user.verify_password('wrong')}")

# Change password with wrong old password
print("\nTrying to change password with wrong old password:")
user.set_password("wrongpass", "newpassword")

# Change password with correct old password
print("\nChanging password with correct old password:")
user.set_password("password123", "newsecurepass456")

# Verify new password
print("\nVerifying new password:")
print(f"Is 'newsecurepass456' correct? {user.verify_password('newsecurepass456')}")
```

### Explanation
- The password is private and never exposed directly
- `verify_password()` compares internally without returning the actual password
- `set_password()` requires the old password, preventing unauthorized changes
- This is security through encapsulation: the password is protected
- Even if you have a User object, you cannot read the password
- This models real-world security where passwords should never be displayed
- The username is read-only (no setter provided)
- Encapsulation provides security by controlling access to sensitive data
