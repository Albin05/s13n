# LO-14: Apply Logical Operators

## Learning Objective
Students will be able to use logical operators (and, or, not) to combine and manipulate boolean expressions.

## Duration
20-25 minutes

## Key Concepts Covered
1. **Logical AND**: Both conditions must be True
2. **Logical OR**: At least one condition must be True
3. **Logical NOT**: Reverses the boolean value
4. **Combining Operators**: Creating complex conditions
5. **Short-Circuit Evaluation**: How Python optimizes logical operations

## Prerequisites
- LO-6: Implement Boolean Data Types
- LO-13: Use Comparison Operators

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Use `and`, `or`, and `not` operators correctly
- Combine multiple conditions
- Understand truth tables for logical operators
- Apply logical operators in real-world scenarios
