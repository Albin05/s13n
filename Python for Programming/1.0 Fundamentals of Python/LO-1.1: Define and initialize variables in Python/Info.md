# LO-1: Define Variables

## Learning Objective
Students will be able to define variables and understand how Python stores data in memory.

## Duration
15-20 minutes

## Prerequisites
- Python installed and running
- Basic understanding of running Python code
- Text editor or IDE configured

## Key Concepts Covered
1. **Variables**: Named containers that store data
2. **Assignment Operator**: Using `=` to assign values
3. **Variable Reassignment**: Changing variable values
4. **Memory Model**: Understanding how variables work in memory

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this learning objective, students will be able to:
- [ ] Create variables using the assignment operator
- [ ] Understand how the `=` operator works (assignment, not equality)
- [ ] Reassign variables with new values
- [ ] Explain how variables work as references to memory locations

## Real-World Applications
- **Gaming**: Storing player score, character name, current level
- **E-commerce**: Keeping track of cart total, item count, user ID
- **Finance**: Recording account balance, transaction amounts, interest rates

## Common Misconceptions
1. **Misconception**: `=` means "equals" like in math
   - **Reality**: `=` means "assign" - it puts the value on the right into the variable on the left

2. **Misconception**: Variables are permanent once created
   - **Reality**: Variables can be reassigned to new values anytime

3. **Misconception**: Variable names must match the data they store
   - **Reality**: You can name variables anything (following rules), though descriptive names are best

## Success Criteria
Students demonstrate mastery when they can:
- Create multiple variables in a program
- Reassign variables with new values
- Explain the difference between `age = 25` and `age == 25`
- Use variables to store different types of data

## Next Steps
After mastering LO-1, students will move to:
- **LO-2**: Apply Variable Naming Conventions (learning the rules for valid names)
