# Pre-Read: Define Functions

## What are Functions?

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello!")

greet()  # Calls the function
# Output: Hello!
```

## Why Use Functions?

1. **Reusability**: Write once, use many times
2. **Organization**: Break code into logical pieces
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and debug

## Basic Syntax

```python
def function_name():
    # Code here
    pass
```

## Example

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, World!")

# Call the function
say_hello()
say_hello()
say_hello()

# Output: Hello, World! (3 times)
```
