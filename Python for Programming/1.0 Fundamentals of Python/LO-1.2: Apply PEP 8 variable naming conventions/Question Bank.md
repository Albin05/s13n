# Question Bank: Apply Variable Naming Conventions

## Problem 1 (Easy)
Which variables are valid?
a) `student_name`
b) `2nd_place`
c) `first-name`  
d) `_private`

## Problem 2 (Easy)
Rename using snake_case:
- `studentName` →
- `TotalScore` →
- `userEmail` →

## Problem 3 (Medium)
Fix these invalid names:
```python
1st_place = "Gold"
user-email = "test@test.com"
for = 10
total$price = 99.99
```

## Problem 4 (Medium)
Create variables for a student profile using proper naming:
- First name
- Last name  
- Age
- GPA
- Is enrolled (boolean)

## Problem 5 (Hard)
Identify and explain what's wrong with each:
```python
user@domain = "test"
className = "Math"
MAX_value = 100
first name = "Alice"
my-var = 50
```
