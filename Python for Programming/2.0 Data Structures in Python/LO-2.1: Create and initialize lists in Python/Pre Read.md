# Pre-Read: Create Lists

## What are Lists?

Lists store multiple items in a single variable.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Creating Lists

Use square brackets `[]`:

```python
empty = []
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
```

## Why Use Lists?

- Store multiple related items
- Keep data organized
- Easy to loop through
- Can be modified
