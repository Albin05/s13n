# LO-95: Create Correlation Matrices

## Learning Objective
Students will be able to create correlation matrices using Statistical Libraries for data analytics and manipulation.

## Duration
30-35 minutes

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python syntax (variables, functions, control flow)
- Python environment setup
- NumPy and Pandas (LO-1 to LO-78)
- Statistical concepts basics

## Key Concepts Covered
1. **Create Correlation Matrices** - Core concept and theory
2. **Syntax and Usage** - How to implement create correlation matrices
3. **Best Practices** - Industry-standard approaches
4. **Common Pitfalls** - What to avoid and why
5. **Performance Considerations** - Writing efficient code

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this learning objective, students will be able to:
- [ ] Understand the concept of create correlation matrices
- [ ] Apply create correlation matrices in real-world data analytics scenarios
- [ ] Write efficient Statistical Libraries code for create correlation matrices
- [ ] Debug common issues related to create correlation matrices
- [ ] Evaluate when to use create correlation matrices vs alternative approaches

## Real-World Applications
- **Quality Control**: Statistical process control, defect analysis
- **Research**: Hypothesis testing, experimental design
- **Risk Management**: Outlier detection, anomaly analysis

## Common Misconceptions
1. **Misconception**: This is just theoretical knowledge
   - **Reality**: Create Correlation Matrices is used daily by data analysts and scientists in production systems

2. **Misconception**: You can skip this and learn later
   - **Reality**: Create Correlation Matrices is a foundation for more advanced analytics concepts

3. **Misconception**: There's only one way to do this
   - **Reality**: Statistical Libraries offers multiple approaches - we'll learn the most efficient ones

## Success Criteria
Students demonstrate mastery when they can:
- Implement create correlation matrices without reference
- Explain why and when to use this technique
- Debug errors independently
- Apply the concept to new problems
- Write efficient, production-quality code

## Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## Next Steps
After mastering LO-95, students will progress to:
- **LO-96**: Perform Simple Linear Regression
