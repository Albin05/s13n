# Pre-Read: Normalize Data (Min-Max Scaling)

## What You'll Learn
In this lesson, you'll master **normalize data (min-max scaling)** - a crucial skill for data analytics with Statistical Libraries. This will enable you to work with real-world datasets more effectively.

## Why This Matters
Imagine you're a data analyst at a major company. You receive a dataset with thousands of rows. You must validate if your results are statistically significant. Normalize Data (Min-Max Scaling) provides the mathematical foundation.

Without knowing how to normalize data (min-max scaling), this simple task becomes nearly impossible. That's why this skill is essential!

## Introduction to Normalize Data (Min-Max Scaling)

**Normalize Data (Min-Max Scaling)** is a fundamental technique in Statistical Libraries that allows you to work with data more effectively. This operation is used daily by data analysts, data scientists, and ML engineers worldwide.

### Basic Syntax

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Basic statistical operation
import scipy.stats as stats
result = stats.operation()  # Placeholder
```

---

## Simple Example

Let's start with a practical example:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Simple example for Normalize Data (Min-Max Scaling)
# This demonstrates the basic concept
print('Example for LO-100')
```

**Output:**
```
Example output for LO-100
```
