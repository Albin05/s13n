# Pre-Read: Perform Hypothesis Testing (t-test)

## What You'll Learn
In this lesson, you'll master **perform hypothesis testing (t-test)** - a crucial skill for data analytics with Statistical Libraries. This will enable you to work with real-world datasets more effectively.

## Why This Matters
Imagine you're a data analyst at a major company. You receive a dataset with thousands of rows. You must validate if your results are statistically significant. Perform Hypothesis Testing (t-test) provides the mathematical foundation.

Without knowing how to perform hypothesis testing (t-test), this simple task becomes nearly impossible. That's why this skill is essential!

## Introduction to Perform Hypothesis Testing (t-test)

**Perform Hypothesis Testing (t-test)** is a fundamental technique in Statistical Libraries that allows you to work with data more effectively. This operation is used daily by data analysts, data scientists, and ML engineers worldwide.

### Basic Syntax

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Basic statistical operation
import scipy.stats as stats
result = stats.operation()  # Placeholder
```

---

## Simple Example

Let's start with a practical example:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Simple example for Perform Hypothesis Testing (t-test)
# This demonstrates the basic concept
print('Example for LO-102')
```

**Output:**
```
Example output for LO-102
```

## When to Use Perform Hypothesis Testing (t-test)

You should use perform hypothesis testing (t-test) when:

- When you need to perform hypothesis testing (t-test)
- When working with real-world data
- When efficiency matters

---

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you're working at a company analyzing data. Perform Hypothesis Testing (t-test) helps you solve problems like processing customer information, analyzing trends, and generating reports.
