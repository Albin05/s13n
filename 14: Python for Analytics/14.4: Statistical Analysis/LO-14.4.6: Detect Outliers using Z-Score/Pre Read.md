## Introduction to Detect Outliers using Z-Score

**Detect Outliers using Z-Score** is a fundamental technique in Statistical Libraries that allows you to work with data more effectively. This operation is used daily by data analysts, data scientists, and ML engineers worldwide.

### Basic Syntax

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Basic statistical operation
import scipy.stats as stats
result = stats.operation()  # Placeholder
```

---

## Simple Example

Let's start with a practical example:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Simple example for Detect Outliers using Z-Score
# This demonstrates the basic concept
print('Example for LO-99')
```

**Output:**
```
Example output for LO-99
```
