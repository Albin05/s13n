# Pre-Read: Standardize Data (Z-Score Normalization)

## What You'll Learn
In this lesson, you'll master **standardize data (z-score normalization)** - a crucial skill for data analytics with Statistical Libraries. This will enable you to work with real-world datasets more effectively.

## Why This Matters
Imagine you're a data analyst at a major company. You receive a dataset with thousands of rows. You must validate if your results are statistically significant. Standardize Data (Z-Score Normalization) provides the mathematical foundation.

Without knowing how to standardize data (z-score normalization), this simple task becomes nearly impossible. That's why this skill is essential!

## Introduction to Standardize Data (Z-Score Normalization)

**Standardize Data (Z-Score Normalization)** is a fundamental technique in Statistical Libraries that allows you to work with data more effectively. This operation is used daily by data analysts, data scientists, and ML engineers worldwide.

### Basic Syntax

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Basic statistical operation
import scipy.stats as stats
result = stats.operation()  # Placeholder
```

---

## Simple Example

Let's start with a practical example:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Simple example for Standardize Data (Z-Score Normalization)
# This demonstrates the basic concept
print('Example for LO-101')
```

**Output:**
```
Example output for LO-101
```
