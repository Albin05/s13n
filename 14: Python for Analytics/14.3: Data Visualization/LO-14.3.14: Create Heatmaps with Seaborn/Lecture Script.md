# Lecture Script: Create Heatmaps with Seaborn

## Pre-Lecture Setup (5 minutes before class)

**Instructor Preparation**:
- [ ] Open Jupyter Notebook / IDE
- [ ] Test that Matplotlib is installed
- [ ] Load sample datasets (if needed)
- [ ] Open documentation in browser tab
- [ ] Review common student questions from previous sessions

**Environment Check**:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print("Environment ready!")
```

## Lecture Delivery Guide

### Opening (Minutes 0-3)

**[INSTRUCTOR SPEAKS]**

"Welcome everyone! Today we're going to learn about **Create Heatmaps with Seaborn** - one of the most important skills in data analytics.

Before we dive in, quick question: Have you ever needed to create heatmaps with seaborn when working with data?

[Wait for responses, acknowledge 2-3 answers]

Great answers! Let's see how create heatmaps with seaborn solves this problem."

**[INSTRUCTOR DEMONSTRATES]**

Open your coding environment and follow along:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Opening demonstration for Create Heatmaps with Seaborn
print('Welcome to the lesson!')
```

"See how powerful that is? Let's break down what just happened."

---

### Concept Introduction (Minutes 3-8)

**[INSTRUCTOR EXPLAINS]**

"Let's understand the core concept. Create Heatmaps with Seaborn is a technique that allows you to work with data efficiently.

Think of it this way: Think of create heatmaps with seaborn like organizing files on your computer - it makes everything easier to find and use.

Let me show you the basic syntax:"

**[WRITE ON BOARD / SCREEN]**

```
# Syntax structure for Create Heatmaps with Seaborn
result = function(data, parameters)
```

"The key parts are:
1. The data input
2. The operation parameters
3. The resulting output"

---

### Live Coding Demo 1 - Basic (Minutes 8-15)

**[INSTRUCTOR CODES LIVE]**

"Let's try a real example together. Imagine we need to process scenario 1 data

I'll type this out - follow along in your own editor:"

```python
# Demo 1 for Create Heatmaps with Seaborn
print('Demo 1')
```

**[INSTRUCTOR RUNS CODE]**

"What do we see? [Point to output]

The output shows how create heatmaps with seaborn works in practice.

Now, quick exercise: Try to create heatmaps with seaborn with your own data.

[Give students 2 minutes to try]

Let's see what you got... [Review 2-3 student solutions]"

---

### Live Coding Demo 2 - Intermediate (Minutes 15-20)

**[INSTRUCTOR CONTINUES]**

"Good! Now let's level up. What if we need to we need to process scenario 2 data

This is where create heatmaps with seaborn really shines:"

```python
# Demo 2 for Create Heatmaps with Seaborn
print('Demo 2')
```

**[INSTRUCTOR PAUSES]**

"Before I run this, what do you think will happen? [Take 2-3 predictions]

Let's find out..." [Runs code]

"Exactly! Notice how the operation handles data efficiently"

---

### Common Mistakes Section (Minutes 20-23)

**[INSTRUCTOR WARNS]**

"Now, let me show you the mistakes I see ALL THE TIME. Learn from these:

**Mistake #1**: Incorrect syntax"

**[INTENTIONALLY WRITE WRONG CODE]**

```python
# WRONG: Common mistake 1
print('incorrect code')
```

"Who can spot the problem? [Wait for responses]

Right! The issue is This mistake occurs because of misunderstanding concept 1. Always remember to follow best practices.

Here's the fix:"

```python
# CORRECT: Fixed version 1
print('correct code')
```

---

### Hands-On Practice (Minutes 23-25)

**[INSTRUCTOR ASSIGNS EXERCISE]**

"Okay, YOUR TURN! I want you to Create a medium solution that demonstrates create heatmaps with seaborn.

You have 5 minutes. Start coding! I'll walk around to help.

[WHILE STUDENTS WORK]
- Circulate the room / monitor chat
- Answer individual questions
- Note common struggles for group discussion

[AFTER 5 MINUTES]

Let's review solutions. Who wants to share? [Screen share or write on board]

[Review solution, explain key points]"

---

### Real-World Application (Minutes 25-3)

**[INSTRUCTOR SHOWS REAL EXAMPLE]**

"Let me show you how this is used in the real world. In production environments, data analysts use create heatmaps with seaborn daily.

Here's actual code from a data analytics project:"

```python
# Real-world case study for Create Heatmaps with Seaborn
print('Case study implementation')
```

"In production, data analysts use create heatmaps with seaborn for:
- Processing customer data
- Generating reports
- Analyzing trends"

---

### Summary and Q&A (Final 3 minutes)

**[INSTRUCTOR SUMMARIZES]**

"Let's recap what we learned today:

1. Key learning point 1 about create heatmaps with seaborn
2. Key learning point 2 about create heatmaps with seaborn
3. Key learning point 3 about create heatmaps with seaborn

The most important thing to remember: Master create heatmaps with seaborn through practice and application.

**Questions?** [Open floor for Q&A]

**Homework**: Complete the Question Bank problems for LO-92. Practice until you can do this without looking at notes!

**Next Class**: We'll build on this to learn Create Pair Plots for Multivariate Analysis.

Great work today, everyone!"

## Post-Lecture Notes

**Common Student Questions to Prepare For**:
1. How do I know when to use create heatmaps with seaborn?
2. What if I get an error?
3. Is there a faster way to do this?

**If Students Struggle With**:
- Concept understanding → Use the analogy: Think of create heatmaps with seaborn like organizing files on your computer - it makes everything easier to find and use.
- Syntax errors → Review the basic template step-by-step
- Performance → Explain optimization in next session
