# Pre-Read: Create Line Plots

## What You'll Learn
In this lesson, you'll master **create line plots** - a crucial skill for data analytics with Matplotlib. This will enable you to work with real-world datasets more effectively.

## Why This Matters
Imagine you're a data analyst at a major company. You receive a dataset with thousands of rows. You need to present your findings to stakeholders. Create Line Plots makes your insights visual and understandable.

Without knowing how to create line plots, this simple task becomes nearly impossible. That's why this skill is essential!

## Introduction to Create Line Plots

**Create Line Plots** is a fundamental technique in Matplotlib that allows you to work with data more effectively. This operation is used daily by data analysts, data scientists, and ML engineers worldwide.

### Basic Syntax

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Basic Matplotlib syntax
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
plt.show()
```

---

## Simple Example

Let's start with a practical example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simple example for Create Line Plots
# This demonstrates the basic concept
print('Example for LO-80')
```

**Output:**
```
Example output for LO-80
```

## When to Use Create Line Plots

You should use create line plots when:

- When you need to create line plots
- When working with real-world data
- When efficiency matters

---

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you're working at a company analyzing data. Create Line Plots helps you solve problems like processing customer information, analyzing trends, and generating reports.

## Key Takeaways

Before class, remember:

1. **Create Line Plots** is essential for create line plots and data processing
2. **Matplotlib** provides efficient tools for this operation
3. Understanding the **syntax** is the first step
4. **Practice** with simple examples before complex ones

## Try It Yourself (Before Class)

Run this code and observe the results:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Try this code for Create Line Plots
print('Practice example')
```

Experiment by:
- Change the data values and see what happens
- Try with different data types
- Experiment with error cases
