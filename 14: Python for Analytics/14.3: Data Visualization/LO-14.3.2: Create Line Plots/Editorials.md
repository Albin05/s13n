## Learning from Solutions

### Key Patterns to Remember

1. **Pattern**: Vectorized operations
   - Use when: Use when working with large datasets

2. **Pattern**: Method chaining
   - Use when: Use when working with large datasets

### Debugging Tips

If you got stuck on these problems:
- Print intermediate results to understand data flow
- Check data types using type() or dtype
- Read error messages carefully - they often point to the exact issue

### Next Steps for Practice

Now that you've seen the solutions:
1. Close this file and try to solve the problems again from memory
2. Modify the problems with different data
3. Time yourself solving Easy problems (target: under 5 minutes)
4. Explain your solution to a peer

**Remember**: Understanding these solutions is just the start. True mastery comes from solving similar problems independently!
