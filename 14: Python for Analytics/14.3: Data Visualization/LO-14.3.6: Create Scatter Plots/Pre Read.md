# Pre-Read: Create Scatter Plots

## What You'll Learn
In this lesson, you'll master **create scatter plots** - a crucial skill for data analytics with Matplotlib. This will enable you to work with real-world datasets more effectively.

## Why This Matters
Imagine you're a data analyst at a major company. You receive a dataset with thousands of rows. You need to present your findings to stakeholders. Create Scatter Plots makes your insights visual and understandable.

Without knowing how to create scatter plots, this simple task becomes nearly impossible. That's why this skill is essential!

## Introduction to Create Scatter Plots

**Create Scatter Plots** is a fundamental technique in Matplotlib that allows you to work with data more effectively. This operation is used daily by data analysts, data scientists, and ML engineers worldwide.

### Basic Syntax

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Basic Matplotlib syntax
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
plt.show()
```

---

## Simple Example

Let's start with a practical example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simple example for Create Scatter Plots
# This demonstrates the basic concept
print('Example for LO-84')
```

**Output:**
```
Example output for LO-84
```

## When to Use Create Scatter Plots

You should use create scatter plots when:

- When you need to create scatter plots
- When working with real-world data
- When efficiency matters

---

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you're working at a company analyzing data. Create Scatter Plots helps you solve problems like processing customer information, analyzing trends, and generating reports.

## Key Takeaways

Before class, remember:

1. **Create Scatter Plots** is essential for create scatter plots and data processing
2. **Matplotlib** provides efficient tools for this operation
3. Understanding the **syntax** is the first step
4. **Practice** with simple examples before complex ones

## Try It Yourself (Before Class)

Run this code and observe the results:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Try this code for Create Scatter Plots
print('Practice example')
```

Experiment by:
- Change the data values and see what happens
- Try with different data types
- Experiment with error cases
