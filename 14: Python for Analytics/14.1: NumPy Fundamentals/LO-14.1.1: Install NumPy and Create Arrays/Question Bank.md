## Question Bank: Install NumPy and Create Arrays

### Q1: Create a 1D Array (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Write Python code to create a NumPy array from the list `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and print it along with its data type.

**Expected Output:**
```
[10 20 30 40 50]
int64
```

### Q2: Create a 2D Array (3 minutes, Low Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Create a 2x3 NumPy array from the nested list `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`. Print the array and its shape.

**Expected Output:**
```
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
(2, 3)
```

### Q3: Array from Tuple with Specific dtype (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Create a NumPy array from the tuple `(5, 10, 15, 20)` with data type `float32`. Print the array and verify its dtype.

**Expected Output:**
```
[ 5. 10. 15. 20.]
float32
```

### Q4: Temperature Data Conversion (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
You have temperature readings in Celsius stored in a Python list: `[25, 30, 22, 28, 35]`.
1. Convert this list to a NumPy array
2. Convert all temperatures to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C × 9/5) + 32
3. Print the Fahrenheit temperatures

**Expected Output:**
```
[77.  86.  71.6 82.4 95. ]
```

### Q5: Create and Analyze Student Scores (5 minutes, Medium Difficulty)

**Problem:**
Create a 2D NumPy array representing test scores for 4 students across 3 subjects:
- Student 1: [85, 90, 78]
- Student 2: [92, 88, 95]
- Student 3: [78, 85, 80]
- Student 4: [90, 92, 88]

Print:
1. The complete array
2. The shape of the array
3. The data type of the array

**Expected Output:**
```
[[85 90 78]
 [92 88 95]
 [78 85 80]
 [90 92 88]]
(4, 3)
int64
```
