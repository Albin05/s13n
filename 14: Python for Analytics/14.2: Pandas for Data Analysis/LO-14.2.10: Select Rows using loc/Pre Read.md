# Pre-Read: Select Rows using loc

## What You'll Learn
In this lesson, you'll master **select rows using loc** - a crucial skill for data analytics with Pandas. This will enable you to work with real-world datasets more effectively.

## Why This Matters
Imagine you're a data analyst at a major company. You receive a dataset with thousands of rows. You need to process customer data in a DataFrame. To get insights, you must select rows using loc.

Without knowing how to select rows using loc, this simple task becomes nearly impossible. That's why this skill is essential!

## Simple Example

Let's start with a practical example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Simple example for Select Rows using loc
# This demonstrates the basic concept
print('Example for LO-28')
```

**Output:**
```
Example output for LO-28
```
