# Pre-Read: Filter DataFrame using Boolean Conditions

## What You'll Learn
In this lesson, you'll master **filter dataframe using boolean conditions** - a crucial skill for data analytics with Pandas. This will enable you to work with real-world datasets more effectively.

## Why This Matters
Imagine you're a data analyst at a major company. You receive a dataset with thousands of rows. You need to process customer data in a DataFrame. To get insights, you must filter dataframe using boolean conditions.

Without knowing how to filter dataframe using boolean conditions, this simple task becomes nearly impossible. That's why this skill is essential!

## Introduction to Filter DataFrame using Boolean Conditions

**Filter DataFrame using Boolean Conditions** is a fundamental technique in Pandas that allows you to work with data more effectively. This operation is used daily by data analysts, data scientists, and ML engineers worldwide.

### Basic Syntax

```python
import pandas as pd

# Basic Pandas syntax
df = pd.DataFrame({'col': [1, 2, 3]})
result = df.operation()  # Placeholder for specific operation
```

---

## Simple Example

Let's start with a practical example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Simple example for Filter DataFrame using Boolean Conditions
# This demonstrates the basic concept
print('Example for LO-30')
```

**Output:**
```
Example output for LO-30
```
