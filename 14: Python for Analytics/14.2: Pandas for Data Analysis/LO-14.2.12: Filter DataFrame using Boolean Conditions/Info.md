# LO-30: Filter DataFrame using Boolean Conditions

## Learning Objective
Students will be able to filter dataframe using boolean conditions using Pandas for data analytics and manipulation.

## Duration
30-35 minutes

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python syntax (variables, functions, control flow)
- Python environment setup
- Pandas installation (LO-19)
- Series and DataFrame basics (LO-19 to LO-26)

## Key Concepts Covered
1. **Filter DataFrame using Boolean Conditions** - Core concept and theory
2. **Syntax and Usage** - How to implement filter dataframe using boolean conditions
3. **Best Practices** - Industry-standard approaches
4. **Common Pitfalls** - What to avoid and why
5. **Performance Considerations** - Writing efficient code

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this learning objective, students will be able to:
- [ ] Understand the concept of filter dataframe using boolean conditions
- [ ] Apply filter dataframe using boolean conditions in real-world data analytics scenarios
- [ ] Write efficient Pandas code for filter dataframe using boolean conditions
- [ ] Debug common issues related to filter dataframe using boolean conditions
- [ ] Evaluate when to use filter dataframe using boolean conditions vs alternative approaches

## Real-World Applications
- **Business Analytics**: Sales data analysis, customer segmentation
- **Marketing**: Campaign performance tracking, A/B testing
- **Operations**: Supply chain optimization, inventory management

## Common Misconceptions
1. **Misconception**: This is just theoretical knowledge
   - **Reality**: Filter DataFrame using Boolean Conditions is used daily by data analysts and scientists in production systems

2. **Misconception**: You can skip this and learn later
   - **Reality**: Filter DataFrame using Boolean Conditions is a foundation for more advanced analytics concepts

3. **Misconception**: There's only one way to do this
   - **Reality**: Pandas offers multiple approaches - we'll learn the most efficient ones

## Success Criteria
Students demonstrate mastery when they can:
- Implement filter dataframe using boolean conditions without reference
- Explain why and when to use this technique
- Debug errors independently
- Apply the concept to new problems
- Write efficient, production-quality code

## Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## Next Steps
After mastering LO-30, students will progress to:
- **LO-31**: Filter with Multiple Conditions
