# LO-85: Create Pie Charts

## Learning Objective
Students will be able to create pie charts using Matplotlib for data analytics and manipulation.

## Duration
25-30 minutes

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python syntax (variables, functions, control flow)
- Python environment setup
- Pandas DataFrames (LO-19 to LO-66)
- Data cleaning and preparation

## Key Concepts Covered
1. **Create Pie Charts** - Core concept and theory
2. **Syntax and Usage** - How to implement create pie charts
3. **Best Practices** - Industry-standard approaches
4. **Common Pitfalls** - What to avoid and why
5. **Performance Considerations** - Writing efficient code

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this learning objective, students will be able to:
- [ ] Understand the concept of create pie charts
- [ ] Apply create pie charts in real-world data analytics scenarios
- [ ] Write efficient Matplotlib code for create pie charts
- [ ] Debug common issues related to create pie charts
- [ ] Evaluate when to use create pie charts vs alternative approaches

## Real-World Applications
- **Reporting**: Executive dashboards, performance metrics
- **Data Journalism**: Story-telling with data
- **Scientific Research**: Publication-quality plots

## Common Misconceptions
1. **Misconception**: This is just theoretical knowledge
   - **Reality**: Create Pie Charts is used daily by data analysts and scientists in production systems

2. **Misconception**: You can skip this and learn later
   - **Reality**: Create Pie Charts is a foundation for more advanced analytics concepts

3. **Misconception**: There's only one way to do this
   - **Reality**: Matplotlib offers multiple approaches - we'll learn the most efficient ones

## Success Criteria
Students demonstrate mastery when they can:
- Implement create pie charts without reference
- Explain why and when to use this technique
- Debug errors independently
- Apply the concept to new problems
- Write efficient, production-quality code

## Difficulty Level
Beginner

## Next Steps
After mastering LO-85, students will progress to:
- **LO-86**: Customize Plot Styles (colors, markers, lines)
