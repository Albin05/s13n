# Pre-Read: Create Pie Charts

## What You'll Learn
In this lesson, you'll master **create pie charts** - a crucial skill for data analytics with Matplotlib. This will enable you to work with real-world datasets more effectively.

## Why This Matters
Imagine you're a data analyst at a major company. You receive a dataset with thousands of rows. You need to present your findings to stakeholders. Create Pie Charts makes your insights visual and understandable.

Without knowing how to create pie charts, this simple task becomes nearly impossible. That's why this skill is essential!

## Introduction to Create Pie Charts

**Create Pie Charts** is a fundamental technique in Matplotlib that allows you to work with data more effectively. This operation is used daily by data analysts, data scientists, and ML engineers worldwide.

### Basic Syntax

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Basic Matplotlib syntax
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
plt.show()
```

---

## Simple Example

Let's start with a practical example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simple example for Create Pie Charts
# This demonstrates the basic concept
print('Example for LO-85')
```

**Output:**
```
Example output for LO-85
```

## When to Use Create Pie Charts

You should use create pie charts when:

- When you need to create pie charts
- When working with real-world data
- When efficiency matters

---

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you're working at a company analyzing data. Create Pie Charts helps you solve problems like processing customer information, analyzing trends, and generating reports.
