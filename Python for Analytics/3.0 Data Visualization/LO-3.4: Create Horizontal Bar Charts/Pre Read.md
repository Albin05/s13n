## Introduction to Create Horizontal Bar Charts

**Create Horizontal Bar Charts** is a fundamental technique in Matplotlib that allows you to work with data more effectively. This operation is used daily by data analysts, data scientists, and ML engineers worldwide.

### Basic Syntax

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Basic Matplotlib syntax
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
plt.show()
```

---

## Simple Example

Let's start with a practical example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simple example for Create Horizontal Bar Charts
# This demonstrates the basic concept
print('Example for LO-82')
```

**Output:**
```
Example output for LO-82
```
